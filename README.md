# AWRU IDL

Archive of Antarctic Wildlife Research Unit code library (mostly IDL)

The AWRU was a research project in the Zoology department of the University of Tasmania in the early 2000s with Mark Hindell and Corey Bradshaw as the primary motivators. 

I haven't done the full task of recording provenance here, yet. Michael Sumner August 2017

## Description

This is here purely for my own purposes, so that I can explore (and recollect) my first experiences with programming, involving animal tracking and remote sensing data. 

This was uploaded from an email in 2013. It was all collected into some kind of useability in 2001, for performing speed filtering and time spent maps on animal tracking data. The IDL resource originated with David Watts at the Australian Antarctic Divison, on their old UNIX systems in the 1990s. It was developed into a system for researchers alongside a reasonable sized satellite remote sensing data repository for performing analyses of behaviours against physical ocean surface properties, primarily for elephant seals and wandering albatross and king penguins at Macquarie Island. 


There's a rambling Word document from 2001-2003 online here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eJWPD2F_QmI0B9vThsto8ftXqQt10naRxDr5z3msrSw/edit?usp=sharing
