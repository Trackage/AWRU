## MDSumner AWRU IDL routines, 8 March 2003

## Document 
##

Mike_SumnerIDL doc describes the filtering and oceanographic data routines
 - it is a little out of date (October 2001)

## Undocumented changes (since October 2001) - incomplete
##

FILTCELLARC now returns data structure from input file
FILT_FILE   now (correctly) returns just the filtered data


## Directories:
##

The majority of the filtering routines are in /awruidl and /JHUAPLS1R

The oceanographic routines that find files (e.g. find_sat_files.pro were
	written to find files on a particular windows machine, or in a local ./satdata
	directory in UNIX.

awruidl - AWRU routines put together my MDsumner (this contains my versions of 
	   some of DJW's routines (MDScell_multi, MDSread_filtptt, readcsv)
coyote    - library of useful routines from www.dfanning.com
DJWatts   - routines supplied by Dave Watts
ice 	  - some sea ice routines from Rob Massom, Antarctic CRC (not implemented by MDS)
Ivisuals  - some instructive routines from Interactive Visuals
JHUAPLS1R - the John Hopkins University library of IDL routines
MDSumner  - routines written and used by Mike Sumner for various things
NASA 	  - routines for NASA datasets (incomplete, and mostly rewritten in awruidl or MDSumner)
ssa	  - sea surface anomaly routines (probably topex/poseiden)


## Note:

fitcellarc.pro was written to provide a one-line interface to the file-reading (readcsv or gl2ptt), 
filtering (MDSread_filtptt or read_filtptt [originally read_argos_data]), gridding (MDScell_multi,
cell_multi) and ARC-friendly-output routines.  No one used it during development, so there are a 
few things that weren't done well - 

	multiple calls to filtcellarc will result in a set of files for each call
		- this happens often when breaking up by animal or week so a better output 
		   organisation is desirable
