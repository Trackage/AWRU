  COLOR_WHEEL: Now lists HSV and RGB values.  RES
29 Jan 2001
  ZWINDOW: Added an option to return image and color table.  RES
  IMG_RADIAL: New routine to correct barrel or pincusion distortion
    in 8 or 24 bit images.  RES
  IMG_RESIZE: Allowed separate x and y mag factors.  RES
26 Jan 2001
  GETFILE: Fixed a bug that dropped the first line when the LINES=
    keyword was used.  RES
24 Jan 2001
  SUNALTAZI: Added new keyword /NOREFRACT to return true altitude
    instead of refracted altitude.  Also now returns true altitude
    if it is less than -1 deg.  RES
19 Jan 2001
  SUNDISK: New routine to give the solar disk central heliographic
    longitude and latitude as seen from anywhere.  Give ecliptic long
    and lat of observer and time.  RES
17 Jan 2001
  TEXTPLOT:  New routine to plot text and allow 2-d alignment.  RES
15 Jan 2001
  GETWRD: Fixed to not blow up for string arrays.  Expects a scalar but
    will use the first element if given an array.  RES
12 Jan 2001
  XCURSOR: Minor upgrade to get map right.  RES
  CROSSI: Updated for latest !map structure.  RES
8 Jan 2001
  IMG_HSV: New routine to adjust image Hue, Saturation, and Value.
    Give hue offset, and sat and val factors.  RES
  IMG_STRETCH: New routine to stretch an image.  Works for 2-D or 3-D images.
    Does grayscale stretching according to given values.  RES
  IMG_SMOOTH: New routine to smooth an image.  Works for 2-D or 3-D images,
    and uses convolution smoothing.  Can smooth less than the IDL smooth
    routine using a 3x3 window.  RES
  XVIEW: Edited to use following renamed routines.  RES
  IMG_RESIZE: Renamed from resize_img.pro.  RES
  IMG_ROTATE: Renamed from rotate_img.pro.  RES
5 Jan 2001
  YY2YYYY: Added a special check for string values.  If the incoming
    2 digit year is a string then the returned result will be converted
    to string (with no spaces on the ends).  RES
2 Jan 2001
  EXIF_READER: Minor error handling upgrade.  RES
  SCREENJPEG: Fixed a minor bug in the non-standard extension listing.  RES
28 Dec 2000
  CONVEXHULL: Dropped.  I thought this used to work but it doesn't
    now. Use triangulate instead.  It optionally returns the indices
    of points on the convex hull.  RES
26 Dec 2000
  SPH_RANGE_MAP: Added a bit more help text.  RES
  CRS_EDIT: Fixed to work on new computer.  Might break elsewhere. 
    Old code just commented out so could fix.   RES
  SPL_ANGINT: Fixed help text error.  RES
  SCREENGIF: Modified to optionally return the image array.  This allows
    it to be used for other purposes, such as extracting scaling info
    using set_scale (if available).  RES
  EXIF_READER: New routine to read values from Exif files.  Exif files
    are the JPEG files recent digital cameras.  This routine can list 
    values such is when the image was shot (to the fraction of a second
    in some cases, f-number, shutter speed, focal length used, and lots
    of other values.  It can also return these values in a structure.
    Can optionally list all tags found in the Exif file.  RES
20 Dec 2000
  HEXDUMP: Modified to allow byte arrays to be dumped.  RES
18 Dec 2000
  ZWINDOW: Fixed a to make a new window for /copy if the old was deleted.  RES
22 Nov 2000
  HEXDUMP: New routine to do a hex dump of a file.  RES
20 Nov 2000
  COLOR_WHEEL: New routine, interactive color picker using a
    color wheel.  Returns a 24 bit color value.   RES
14 Nov 2000
  XYOUTB: Added new keyword SHIFT=shft.  This allows easy drop shadows
    using values like shift=[-2,2] for color=[black,white].  RES
9 Nov 2000
  MAP_SET_SCALE: Minor fix to use given image instead of reading it.  RES
30 Oct 2000
  PHASE: Fixed a minor indexing problem.  RES
25 Oct 2000
  GIF2PNG: New routine to convert GIF images to PNG.  Both GIF and PNG
    are lossless formats.  Current IDL write_png appears to write the
    images flipped in Y.  Other applications then bring them in
    flipped (like web browsers).  So for now this routine flips the
    image before writing.  This may be fixed in the next version of
    IDL, but GIF won't be supported so it won't matter anyway.  RES
3 Oct 2000
  XVIEW: Fixed to work for 8 bits (again).  RES
26 Sep 2000
  XVIEW: Upgraded to deal with 24-bit display.  Now loads images.
    Next fix to save images.  RES
  SIZE_IMG: New routine to return image interleave index (if true color)
    and dimensions for any 2-D or 3-D color image.  RES
21 Sep 2000
  RESIZE_IMG: New routine to apply congrid to color images.  RES
  ROTATE_IMG: New routine to apply the rotate function to color images.
    Rotate only works for 1-d and 2-d arrays.  This routine checks the
    dimensions and if 3-d finds which dimension is the color channels.  RES
20 Sep 2000
  TARCLR: Modified to check for decomp=0 and treat as 8-bit color.  This
    makes it work with color tables even on 24-bit displays.  RES
19 Sep 2000
  DAYGLOBE: Modified to list ref point and sun pos at ref pt.  RES
  SUN_COLORS: Added 10 degree banded day color tables (use /quantized).  RES
12 Sep 2000
  MOVTXT: Added color to text display commands.  RES
11 Sep 2000
  GIFSCREEN: Updated for 24 bit color.  RES
30 Aug 2000
  XTXTIN: Now allows null strings for ptags and pvals but ignores and
    does not give preset button menu.  RES
28 Aug 2000
  CREATED: Added new keyword VERB=txt to allow wording to be changed.  RES
23 Aug 2000
  SCREENGIF: Fixed to only do any device,decomp commands for X device.  RES
22 Aug 2000
  XTXTIN: Added preset text option.  Can load up this widget with
    lots of text that can be selected using a drop down menu button.
    Uses short tags to specify text.  RES
21 Aug 2000
  EQV3: Added XOFFSET, YOFFSET to position widget.  RES
18 Aug 2000
  XCURSOR: Added new keyword TEXT to set text to display (def=Press
    any button to exit).  May be a text array.  Also fixed a problem
    with the input coordionates: the !x.typ changed from 2 to 3 for
    maps.  Also !map changed to default x,y for maps changed. RES
17 Aug 2000
  XTXTIN: Added new keyword XSIZE to allow width to be set.  RES
  XCURSOR: Added XOFFSET and YOFFSET keywords to allow status display
    to be positioned.  RES
  DT_TM_TOJS: Added /QUIET keyword to make handling errors cleaner.  RES
14 Aug 2000
  RESCOM: Fixed a bug for the case where r_swap was undefined.  This
    came up on resopen,/write.  Now just ignores r_swap if not defined.  RES
8 Aug 2000
  XCURVE: Fixed a problem with repeated points.  Still does not erase
    old points very well.  RES
4 Aug 2000
  XYOUTB: Foxed a bug that came up for bold=0.  RES
1 Aug 2000
  DATA_BLOCK: The calling line # changed for some reason making this
    routine break.  Fixed to work, but might break on another system.  RES
28 Jul 2000
  LMST: Fixed an error in a comment, had wrong date for initial time.  RES
29 Jun 2000
  SUBIMG: Modified to deal with 24 bit color displays.  RES
  SCREENJPEG: Modified to deal with 24 bit color displays.  RES
  JPEGSCREEN: Modified to deal with 24 bit color displays.  RES
  SCREENGIF: Modified to do device,decomp=0 and also map_set_scale.  RES
  MAP_SET_SCALE: Added IMAGE=img keyword so scale can be set from
    a given image instead of reading from screen image.  RES
  SET_SCALE: fixed a minor typo.  RES
29 Jun 2000
  XVIEW: Fixed a typo in the code (don't know how it got there, hasn't
    been touched for quite a while).  RES
23 Jun 2000
  JSPLOT: Added new keyword: LSHIFT=sec (see below).  RES
  TIMEAXIS: Added new keyword: LSHIFT=sec to allow axis label to be
    shifted by given number of seconds.  Main intent was to offset
    month labels by 15 days: LSHIFT=15*86400D0 to center on month.  RES
  DT_TM_MAK: Added weekday number to format.  Sun=1, Mon=2, ... Sat=7.  RES
  JS_INCMONTH: Increment a time in Julian Seconds by a month (or
    a given number of months).  So 2000 May 23 12:46:52 would give
    2000 Jun 23 12:46:52.  When used with dt_tm_fromjs this is useful
    for generating a series of monthly file names.  RES
2 Jun 2000
  SCREENGIF: Fixed to correctly handle embedded scaling info for
    24 bit color displays.  RES
1 Jun 2000
  POINT: Added /CLIP option to clip am array of points to the
     clipping window.  RES
31 May 2000
  CPOSPRINT: New routine to print a text string showing character
     positions listed above the text.  RES
23 May 2000
  EQV3: Added =yes or =no to flags to make it easy to see state.  RES
22 May 2000
  HORI: Found this routine broken for 24-bit color.  Fixed.  RES
  SCREENGIF: Fixed to work with Z buffer.  Also now does set_scale.  RES
  ZWINDOW: Fixed to resize display window on /copy if wrong size.  RES
21 May 2000
  EQV3: Added flags, wait option, and return of paramater values.  RES
  EQV3_LOAD_HELP: Loads help text into common for quicker response.  RES
12 May 2000
  EQV3: New routine to execute IDL code or routines with interactively
    varied parameters.  Parameters are varied using slider bars.  More
    general than eqv2 since any IDL code may be used and not just a
    plot.  Perhaps useful to build other routines.  RES
7 May 2000
  ZWINDOW: Fixed a minor bug that clobbered the entry device at times.  RES
20 Apr 2000
  IMGUNDER: Modified to accept /NODATA.  RES
  IZOOM: The /NODATA keyword caused a big problem, so changed to /AXES_ONLY
    instead.  RES
18 Apr 2000
  IZOOM: Added new keyword /NODATA.  Just plots axes.  This is useful
    for mixing 8 and 24 bit graphics.  The first izoom call can display
    an image using a color table by first calling device,decomp=0.
    The do device,decomp=1 and izoom with /nodata.  Second izoom call
    uses 24 bit color for axes so can set to anything (default white). RES
17 Apr 2000
  ZWINDOW: Removed the close on the /COPY command.  Didn't need that.
    Now the z window remembers the image even if the plot device is
    switched to display the /copy.  Changing the color table changes the
    displayed image even for 24-bit color since the z buffer is 8 bit.  RES
11 Apr 2000
  RESOPEN: Fixed to deal with endian.  Detects if endian is same as
    current computer and sets swap flag if not.  This allows res files
    created on opposite endian systems to be readable transparently.  RES
  RESGET: Fixed to deal with endian.  RES
  RESCOM: Fixed to deal with endian.  RES
  RESPUT: Added to internal common, no effect here.  RES
  RESCLOSE: Added to internal common, no effect here.  RES
  ENDIAN: Minor change to work better with rescom.  RES
10 Apr 2000
  TETRIS: Fixed to work for 24 bit color.  Just does a device,decomp=0.
    Should restore original state but doesn't.  RES
28 Mar 2000
  MAP_TEST_SCALE: Just added device,/decomp=0 to allow color.  RES
28 Mar 2000
  ZWINDOW: New routine to use the z buffer for 8 bit images.  Can do 8 bit
    images on a 24 bit display more easily.  Has a copy option to show
    result on screen.  RES
8 Mar 2000
  RESOPEN: Fixed check that tests if file is a res file.  Was assuming header
    size less than some limit, but big files may have bigger headers.  Now
    computes expected file size from first 3 long words.  RES
7 Jan 2000
  DT_TM_MAK: Just clarified the help text to state that I$ and i$ only
    work for sec in dt_tm_mak.  They do not do anything useful if 
    used for dt_tm_fromjs.  RES
6 Jan 2000
  NUMFACTORS: Added new keywords: /QUIET to suppress listing factors,
    and PROGRESS=n to show progress every n values.  RES
  FACTOR: Fixed to ignore 0 or negative values.  RES
3 Jan 2000
  DT_TM_MAK: A problem became apparent when year changed to 2000.  Not
    a Y2K problem but one when year ended in 0, so a decade problem.
    The previous version modified a copy of the format string, but the
    changes modified the format on the fly.  New version bases changes
    on original format string.  Also now uses builtin IDL routines so
    might be a bit faster.  RES
14 Dec 1999
  OBJ_DRAW: Improved the debug mode option.  Can turn the error handler
    on if debug is not on, else do not and real error shows up.  RES
13 Dec 1999
  ENDIAN: New function to determine which endian the current machine uses.
    If data was generated on a machine with a different endian and is
    accessed as other than bytes then the bytes must be swapped using
    byteorder with the proper keyword.  RES
7 Dec 1999
  CROSSI: Fixed to work correctly for /PIXEL for 24 bit color.  Also fixed
    a bug with /MAG.  RES
3 Dec 1999
  PLOTP: Added new keyword THICK.  RES
1 Dec 1999
  SPH_RANGE_MAP: New function to compute the range from a point on a
    sphere for a regular grid of locations on the sphere.  Useful for
    many purposes: sun altitudes, moon phase, range maps, ... RES
30 Nov 1999
  CRS_EDIT: New routine to create or edit a cursor bitmap image and
    mask.  Use to make new cursor shapes.  RES
  ISNUMBER: Fixed a bug found by Kristian Kjaer, Physics Department,
    Risoe National Laboratory, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.
    Was failing for numbers like -5E-2, two - signs.  Also two + signs.
    This routine could be shortened quite a bit if it were rewritten.  RES
  ARRAY_LIST: New routine to list a given array in a form easy to
    cut and paste into new IDL code.  For numeric arrays only, no
    check for strings.  RES
24 Nov 1999
  TARCLR: Added new keyword /B24 to force into 24 bit mode even if
    on an 8 bit system.  Perhaps useful for testing.  RES
16 Nov 1999
  OBJ_DRAW: Added group_leader passing to the object's XSET method.
    The object should use it on the top level control panel base so
    the panel is destroyed when the resizeable window is destroyed.  RES
15 Nov 1999
  OBJ_DRAW: Added a debug option.  Will stop and allow the object method
    that failed to be called manually so error can be seen.  RES
11 Nov 1999
  TARCLR: Upgraded to allow colors to be reserved.  This required a number
    of new keywords: INIT=[lo,hi] Set up a block of working colors,
    /ADD add a new reserved color from the available list, DROP=i drop
    a reserved color from use, /LIST list available colors.  In addition
    SET=i was modified to reserve that selected color if it is in the
    working color range.  Reserved colors allow multiple routines to 
    better shared the same color table space if each needs only a few
    colors.  Add those routines may return the colors when done.  RES
8 Nov 1999
  IMGARRAY: New routine to take a list of GIF images all the same size
    and make an array of reduced versions and save as a GIF.  RES
3 Nov 1999
  LGRADIENT: Simple linear gradient image.  Intended for detrending.  Easy
    specification of parameters.  If a gradient array is generated in G,
    and the image to detrend is in A then New = A*(1+G).  The gradient image
    is 0 at the center, and reaches 1 at a specified distance.  Vary that
    distance to vary the gradient strength.  Gradient angle is given.  RES
  WIN_COPY: Just copied to lib.  Seemed not to have the latest version.  RES
20 Oct 1999
  WHOAMI: Needed line number in the source file.  Went to add it and
    found it was there in the local copy.  Just sending it to the
    main libraries.  RES
19 Oct 1999
  CROSSI: Upgraded for 24 bit color.  RES
  TVRD2: Upgraded for 24 bit color.  RES
  ZPAN: Upgraded for 24 bit color.  RES
18 Oct 1999
  DAYGLOBE: Allowed time to be given as a string or JS.  RES
15 Oct 1999
  SUNALTAZI: Made date/time entry a bit less picky.  RES
  IGLOBE: Allowed horizon to be turned off.  This allows some nice geo-art,
    make the water the same color as the background, and the coast the
    same color as the land, and turn off the horizon.  RES
  DAYGLOBE: Plot a globe and show areas of daylight, twilight, and night.  RES
14 Oct 1999
  WORLD_SUNZD: New routine to compute sun zenith distances for
    points around the world.  Uses the fast algorithm, about 10
    times faster than the old way.  RES
  SUN_COLORS: Added a keyword, /DEEPER, to load the original,
    deeper colors.  RES
12 Oct 1999
  IGLOBE: Keep given arguments within valid bounds.  RES
  TARCLR: Better handling of bad arguments.  RES
11 Oct 1999
  IGLOBE: Made a lot of changes to the on the nearweb site and it
    got overwritten so had to reconstruct.  RES
10 Oct 1999
  IGLOBE: Corrected the GRID flag to accept 0 correctly.  RES
6 Oct 1999
  IGLOBE: New routine to plot a globe.  Made to learn ION Script.  RES
5 Oct 1999
  MAP_PUT_SCALE: Added /EMBED, /NOEMBED, SC_STR=sc_str keywords.  RES
4 Oct 1999
  POSBOX: Modified some time ago to look outside the position box instead
    of inside.  Just updating library.  RES
  MAP_SET_SCALE: Used to set up the map coordinate system as determined
    from the scaling info embedded in the image by map_put_scale.  RES
  MAP_PUT_SCALE: Newly revised (replaces previous version).  Determines
    all the information needed to redefine the map coordinate system and
    embeds it in the first image line.  If the image is then saved in a
    non-lossy format the map coordinates can be set up again after the
    image is loaded to the screen.  Use map_set_scale to do that.
    Note, this routine has a lot of special cases and work arounds since
    not all the needed info is readily available.  Future changes in the
    operation of map_set may break this technique (as happened in the past).
    But it is very useful so may be worth the risk.  RES
28 Sep 1999
  XVIEW: Switched to read_tiff from tiff_read.  Now can read compressed
    TIFF.  But the returned ORDER value seems off, should be 0 or 1 but is
    16436 or 16437.  RES
27 Sep 1999
  JSPLOT: Fixed a bug added when jsplot was modified.  RES
23 Sep 1999
  JSPLOT: New keywords JSMAJOR=jsmaj, JSMINOR=jsmin to return major and minor
    tick mark positions in JS.  Very useful for custom time grids.  RES
  TIMEAXIS: New keywords TMAJOR=tmaj, TMINOR=tmin to return major and minor
    tick mark positions.  RES
15 Sep 1999
  LS: Added new keyword: /NOSCALE to skip actual scaling of the data.
    Used to find the values derived by the histogram technique.
    Should save a little time, not a lot.  RES
  TVSHARP: Added new keywords: SMOOTH=sm, WEIGHT=wt.  Default to original
    values.  RES
13 Sep 1999
  OBJ_DRAW: New routine to do display the results of an object's
    draw method in a resizable window.  RES
9 Sep 1999
  SUNCLOCK: Added optional track plot.  Still need to speed up.  RES
  POSBOX: New routine to check if there is an outline drawn around
    the plot position in the window.  The test is that the possible
    outline all be the same color and not equal to any pixels just
    inside it.  This is a problem if anything on the inside touches
    the possible outline, it will be considered to exist even if it
    doesn't.  The main purpose was to tell if map_set used the
    /noborder keyword.  Should work ok for that.  RES
17 Aug 1999
  COLORIZE: New routine to colorize an image.  Will modify an image based
    on a colorize image.  The colorize image gives the hue and sat, the val
    comes from the original image.  RES
16 Aug 1999
  WIN_REDIRECT: Added disable/enable options as new keywords:
    /ON, /OFF.  This globally changes the operation of redirection
    with one easy call.  RES
12 Aug 1999
  WIN_REDIRECT: New routine.  Makes it easy to modify software to use a
    hidden window to build up a graphics image and then copy it quickly
    to the display window (using WIN_COPY).  RES
  WIN_COPY: Copies the hidden window set up by WIN_REDIRECT to the
    display window.  Can use these two routines to make smoother
    graphics.  RES
10 Aug 1999
  IMGSCALE: Fixed the problem of scrolling windows being locked when running
    imgscale.  Now the middle mouse button displays a move message and
    waits while image is scrolled.  Then the mouse cursor jumps back
    where it was.  RES
9 Aug 1999
  SET_SCALE: Added new keywords IMAGE=img, and /NOSET.  This allows
    image to be passed in so scaling info may be extracted, but the
    scale set can be suppressed to avoid changing the exising scaling.  RES
4 Aug 1999
  DT_TM_TOJS: Improved the 2 digit year fix by using yy2yyyy.  RES
  DATE2JD: Improved the 2 digit year fix by using yy2yyyy.  RES
  YMD2DATE: Improved the 2 digit year fix by using yy2yyyy.  RES
  YY2YYYY: Fixed so it doesn't change 4 digit years.  Also now
    handles arrays and allows a base year to be given to override
    the current year.  RES
2 Aug 1999
  NGROUPS: Return number of groups of identical elements in an array.
    Works like NRUNS.  RES
  GETGROUP: Get N'th group of identical elements from an array.
    Works like GETRUN.  RES
  MONTHNUM: New function to return month number given it's name.
    Jan=1, Feb=2, ...   RES
  YY2YYYY: New function to convert a 2 digit year to a 4 digit year.
    Two digit years will always be useful, this function should work
    without breaking as long as the target year is not more than one
    century away.  It is especially useful around a century rollover
    and for a few years after.  It will convert a 2 digit year to the
    closest 4 digit year.  The keyword /PAST forces the target year to
    be in the past (useful for birthdates).  RES
30 Jul 1999
  TARCLR: Fixed so even for 24 bit color, if the color table is given
    by the keywords RED, GREEN, and BLUE the closest match will be
    found for the given color table.  RES
29 Jul 1999
  TARCLR: Added new keywords: RED=red, GREEN=green, BLUE=blue, and
    /NOLOAD to allow a given color table to be updated using TARCLR
    and optionally avoid screen color table update.  If SET=i is given
    with RED, GREEN, and BLUE then the given color table is updated.
    If SET=i is not given then the given color table is used to find
    the closest target color instead of the color table loaded in the
    device.  RES
28 Jul 1999
  TARCLR: Added new keyword /HSV to allow Hue, Sat, and Val for color
    input.  With the SET=i keyword this routine makes it easy to construct
    custom color tables.  RES
9 Jul 1999
  FACTOR: Fixed bugs introduced by the last upgrade to bigger integers.
    Old IDL can't deal with 1ULL for example (and doesn't even have 1UL
    like I was using).  Routines can't even compile with such a statement,
    but it would be nice to have the same routine work for both IDL 5.2 and
    before.  A useful trick is to hide the new data type in an execute
    statement that only gets called in IDL 5.2 or later.  RES
  PRINT_FACT: Same.  RES
8 Jul 1999
  PUT_SCALE: Added scaling info logging to a text file.  If the new
    keyword LOG=name is given a value then the scaling info is logged
    to the text file put_scale.txt in the HOME directory.  The info
    is appended to an existing put_scale.txt which is created if not there. RES
7 Jul 1999
  FACTOR: Went to unsigned integers, can now work up to the limit of
    ulong64 numbers.  RES
  PRINT_FACT: Same.  RES
2 Jul 1999
  PRINT_FACT: Better formatting.  RES
  SPC: Added /NOTRIM keyword to preserve spaces in given text string.  RES
  BOX2B: Fixed a minor typo in the box listing.  RES
30 Jun 1999
  PRINT_FACT: Modified to handle bigger values, also better printout.  RES
  FACTOR: Improved.  Faster, bigger.  RES
  INT_LOW: New function to drop a value or array to the lowest integer
    precision needed to hold a given value.  The reference value may
    be given separately from the value to convert.  Useful to reduce
    to bytes needed to store values.  RES
  ZERO_INT: New function to return a zero of the same datatype as the
    given argument.  Useful to promote another value of lower precision
    to the higher precision data type: a = a + zero_int(b).  RES
15 Jun 1999
  WIN_OPEN: New function to tell if a window is open for use.  RES
9 Jun 1999
  SCRAMBLE: Upgraded to long ints to allow bigger arrays.  RES
8 Jun 1999
  PUTBITS: New routine to insert specified bits into a target.
    Works for scalars or arrays.  RES
  GETBITS:  Cleaned up some.  Also works for arrays.  RES
  SHOWBITS: Cleaned up some.  Also works for arrays.  RES
7 Jun 1999
  SHOWBITS: New routine to display the bit pattern for integer
    scalar values.  Can display bits in binary, octal, or hex.  RES
4 Jun 1999
  GETBITS: New routine to pick out specified bits from an integer
    data type (byte, int, u_int, long, u_long, long_64, u_long_64).
    Returns bits in same data type but shifted to start at LSB.  RES
  DATATYPE: Added new IDL datatypes.  Also added returned codes useful
    for indicating if a variable is integer, float, complex, or none,
    and how many bits in integer data types.  RES
3 Jun 1999
  BASECON: Added new keyword GROUP=g to group digits together.  This is
    very useful for breaking long strings into bytes or words.
    For example:
	print,basecon(12345,to=2,dig=24,group=8)
	00000000 00110000 00111001
3 May 1999
  SPHPLOT: Fixed a problem with visible hemisphere clipping, was clipping
    away points just slightly in back hemisphere even when far from surface.
    Visible hemisphere was considered any point within 90.01 degrees of
    line of sight.  Now made invisible hemisphere be more than 89.99 so
    /HIDDEN will plot those points.  Also added new keyword, /ALL that
    just ignores hemisphere clipping plane for curves and points.  RES
3 May 1999
  POLREC: Converted to double precision computation.  Angle conversion
    must be careful not to use !radeg for double.  Do radeg=180/!dpi
    instead.  This flows through to polrec3d also.  RES
3 May 1999
  SPHPLOT: Fixed bug in returned plotted points array for the no
    points case. RES
30 Apr 1999
  XVIEW: Worked around a bug in IDL 5.2 that does not allow wdelete if
    no windows exist.  RES
23 Apr 1999
  GETFILE: Fixed a long time bug that made it fail on 1 line files.  RES
14 Apr 1999
  GETFILE: Added new keyword LINES=n to indicate number of lines to
    read from a text file.  This allows large text files to be read
    much faster using getfile.  RES
19 Mar 1999
  LOGLUT: Added some new keywords to generalize.  Can now map between
    specified gray levels and also reverse lookup table.  Default 
    output table is float but can round.  RES
15 Mar 1999
  BOX2B: Added new keyword /YREVERSE to reverse Y coordinate to put
    y=0 at top of window.  Sometimes useful for working with image
    coordinates used by other software packages.  RES
22 Feb 1999
  SCREENGIF: Loaded color table before image, so should work for
    24 bit displays.  RES
25 Nov 1998
  DATE2DOY: New routine to convert from date to day of year.  RES
10 Nov 1998
  LOGLUT: Added keyword /TOP to scale to top available color index. 
    Defaults to 255.  RES
6 Nov 1998
  LOGLUT: New routine to return a log lookup table useful to scale
    images.  Especially useful for 16 bit data.  Can specified various
    lookup table curvatures.  RES
5 Nov 1998
  VUMOV: Now allows a color table in movie file as RED, GREEN, BLUE
    entries.  RES
4 Nov 1998
  VUMOV: Remove the need to give frame XSIZE and YSIZE in res movie
    file.  vumov just detects the correct size from the file itself.
    Also detects frame data type but warns if not type byte.  RES
2 Nov 1998
  WGS_84: New function to return a few useful values for the WGS 84
    ellipsoid (approximation to shape of the earth).  RES
27 Oct 1998
  EQV2: Fixed color bug.  When color was added it messed up cases
    that didn't have color.  Should be fixed.  RES
19 Oct 1998
  IZOOM_SUB: New routine to zoom up part of an image.  Must have embedded
    scaling added by put_scale.  RES
  SET_SCALE: Added an error flag to indicate if no scaling info found.  RES
1 Oct 1998
  VUMOV: New routine to view a movie res file.  Do vumov,/help
    for details.  Useful for long movies too big for memory.  RES
30 Sep 1998
  GRAB_COMMANDS: Added time tag so won't IDL sessions won't overwrite
    each other.  RES
28 Sep 1998
  RESPUT: Dropped code forcing longword alignment of each new write.
    Don't know why that was there, it messed up movie files.  RES
24 Sep 1998
  GRAB_COMMANDS: New routine to grab command line recall buffer and save
    it in a text file.  RES
25 Aug 1998
  JSPLOT: Fixed a problem related to the MAX_VALUE keyword (same as the
    keyword used by PLOT, so not mentioned in the jsplot help).  Was
    setting the default value of this to max(y), but that makes 2 point
    plots not plot the line.  Changed to set the default to max(y)+1.  RES
10 Aug 1998
  DT_TM_MAK: Ran into a problem with the way IDL handles subscripting
    structure arrays.  If you try to insert a value into a single element
    structure array that value must be a scalar, single element arrays are
    not allowed as for normal arrays.  Had to add indexing that is only
    needed for single element arrays.  RES
5 Aug 1998
  XTXTIN: Fixed a bug due to an IDL change where an index cannot be
    a string unless it is converted to numeric.  RES
31 Jul 1998
  WORDARRAY: Added new keyword NUMBER=nwds to return number of words.  RES
  COMMALIST: Added DELIMITER=del keyword to allow delimiters besides
    commas to be used.  Also fixed to work for alphabetic arrays.  RES
27 Jul 1998
  XHELP: Added optional SAVE button.  Just give save=file_name to give
    a default file name for the save.  RES
21 Jul 1998
  BOX2B: Added new exit option: List box position.  Lists in several
    formats, one is position in device (or normal) coord.  Can use
    to set a plot window.  RES
15 Jul 1998
  DT_TM_MAK: A bug was fixed by Tami Kovalick, Raytheon STX, 2 digit years
    failed beyond 1999.  RES
30 Jun 1998
  TAG_TEST: New function to test if a given tag occurs in a given
    structure.  Returns 1 if true, else 0.  RES
19 Jun 1998
  XTXTIN: Added new keywords XOFFSET=xoff, YOFFSET=yoff, see below.  RES
  XOPTION: Added new keywords XOFFSET=xoff, YOFFSET=yoff, see below.  RES
  XMESS: Added new keywords XOFFSET=xoff, YOFFSET=yoff to allow
    positioning this widget.  RES
  XHELP: Just added /no_block to the xmanager call so the program flow
    does not stop here.  This allows xhelp to simply display a useful
    block of text which stays on the screen.  The text in this display
    may be swept up with the mouse and used elsewhere.  RES
  PSTERM: Used the char size passed in by psinit.  RES
  PSINIT: New keyword CHARSIZE=csz, see below.  RES
  PRWINDOW: Added new keyword CHARSIZE=csz to be able to set the size
    of the comment along the side of the printed image.  This allows
    an easy way to list useful info on the image printout.  RES
  NUMPERSEC: New routine to estimate a rate.  Given some value which
    increases with time (such as MB read from a tape) this routine
    returns the number per second increase of that value.  RES
  FSLIDER_SETRANGE: New routine to set the floating point slider min
    and max values.  The floating point slider widget, cw_fslider, does
    not take the widget_control keywords set_slider_min and set_slider_max.
    This routine allows easy changing of those values.  RES
22 May 1998
  SECHMS: Yesterday's fix caused worse problems.  Now a small epsilon
    is added to the incoming value to allow for roundoff error.  The 
    default epsilon is 1E-12, that is the value used by the time
    software.  RES
22 May 1998
  NUMFRAC: New routine to convert a value or values to text strings with
    specified number of decimal places.  RES
21 May 1998
  SECHMS: This is where the DT_TM_MAK bug really got fixed.  RES
  PLTCRV: Added new keyword /XFIX to drop the option to edit x.
    Also fixed a bug that crashed the routine when the last point
    and the same x as the one before.
    Added /LOG to do log Y axis.
    Added /NORMALIZE to normalize curve max to 1.  RES
  DT_TM_MAK: Fixed a bug reported by Dr Dave Watts, Applications Programmer,
    Computing Services, Antarctic Division, Kingston, Tasmania 7050, Australia.
    Was not getting the correct second in some cases where the time was just
    a bit off from an integer value (-2E-14 off in one case).  Now rounds
    to nearest second if no fraction requested, or corrects the seconds
    if off when a fraction is used.  Should now operated as intended. RES
20 May 1998
  PLTCRV: Added XRANGE=xran and YRANGE=yran keywords to keep points
    within specified limits.  RES
18 May 1998
  GETENV2: Had to modify so it will compile when !base_dir does not
    exist.  Used the execute function to do this.  RES
  SPL_ANGINT: Attempt to fix requested angles to be within same range
    as anchor point angles.  Still needs work.  RES
14 May 1998
  SPL_ANGINT: Do a spline interpolation on a periodic angular function.
    Assumes function repeats after 2*PI or 360 deg.  RES
  EQV2: Added lock and unlock keywords to lock parameter values.  RES
13 May 1998
  EQV2: Added an optional OK button that sends an event to the specified
    widget.  Also now returns widget ID for the OK button.  This allows
    input_focus to be set to the OK button to switch context to EQV2
    from the calling routine.  RES
12 May 1998
  EQV2: Fixed to use its own plot window and not just the latest.  RES
  COLORS8BIT: New routine useful when you need to pick colors that will
    be visible when the mouse cursor is outside the IDL graphics window.
    This is useful when using 256 colors on a workstation, sometimes a
    widget becomes useless because the window contents becomes invisible
    when the mouse is moved to the widget (and not in the window).  RES
  RADII: Added new keyword /CLIP to clip to plot window.  Unfortunately
    the sister routine, ARCS, uses /NOCLIP to prevent clipping to the
    plot window (should be changed to use /CLIP).  RES
8 May 1998
  FIXANG: Upgraded to allow angles in radians also.  RES
7 May 1998
  EQV2: Allowed init lines in eqv file.  Useful to set up plot windows.  RES
  EQV2_LOAD_HELP: Added eqv file init lines.  RES

  PLTCRV: Fixed a few minor problems, also updated some obsolete
    spline routines.  RES
4 May 1998
  XAUTOHELP_EXAMPLE: Example widget routine that uses xautohelp.  RES
  XAUTOHELP: New routine to display specified text whenever the cursor is
    moved over selected widgets in a widget application.  Typically such text
    would appear along the bottom of the widget application and could give
    some info on what the item does or how to use it.  RES
30 Apr 1998
  CREATED: Modified to use getenv2 instead of getenv.  This should allow
    porting to non-unix systems.  RES
29 Apr 1998
  EQV2: Fixed printout to give more room for the equation.  Also
    upgraded to ask if brightness should be reversed for a printout
    if that would reduce the amount of black or dark areas.  RES
24 Apr 1998
  EQV2: Upgraded by adding a number of new options and help text.  RES
  EQV2_LOAD_HELP: Uses text_block to load help text into variables.  RES
17 Apr 1998

15 Apr 1998
  SUNJS: Converted several if statements to calls to where so arrays
    of times can be used.  RES
  DT_TM_FROMJS: Just returned NUMBERS structure.  RES
  DT_TM_MAK: Added a returned structure with numeric values, NUMBERS.  RES
14 Apr 1998
  DT_TM_MAK: Added new format item, sam$ = seconds after midnight.  RES
10 Apr 1998
  MAGCRS: Added WINDOW keyword to allow use in a draw widget.
    Also added /NOCURSOR keyword to indicate that incoming coordinates
    are to be used as device coordinates instead of calling the CURSOR
    routine.  Use both WINDOW=win and /NOCURSOR for draw widgets.  RES
9 Apr 1998
  WHOCALLEDME: Generalized to look back farther then parent.  Added
    new keyword BACK=b.  Default is parent as before.  BACK=0 gives
    self, BACK=2 gives grandparent, BACK=3 gives great grandparent,
    and so on.  Going back too far gives null string results.  RES
8 Apr 1998
  MAGCRS: Fixed to show first mag window on /INIT.  Also cleaned up
    the help text some.  RES
7 Apr 1998
  IMGPOLREC: Upgraded to allow non-centered pixels.  The specified ranges
    in angle and radius used to apply to the centers of the first and last
    pixels in angle and radius.  Added new keywords, /A_EDGE and /R_EDGE, so
    the given ranges can apply to the pixel edges to get the full pixels
    instead of cutting the first and last in half as before.  If new
    keywords not used should give same results as before.  RES
1 Apr 1998
  WORDARRAY: Now allows the ignore characters to be given as a simple
    string of characters to drop before processing.  Also allows
    a string of delimiter characters to be given in the same way.  RES
  EQV2: Added /NO_BLOCK to xmanager call to free up command line.  RES
31 Mar 1998
  EQV2: Added SNAP button to make a snapshot of the current equation
    and settings.  RES
30 Mar 1998
  EQV2: Fixed an undefined variable problem.  RES
27 Mar 1998
  EQV2: Fixed a minor glitch that occured when entering a new equation
    file.  Also generalized to allow parametric equations.  This is
    done by specifying a trange instead of xrange, and giving
    x=fx(t) & y=fy(t) instead of just y=f(x).  Can now do circles
    very easily.  RES
20 Mar 1998
  DT_TM_FULL: Upgraded a bit to deal with dashes, slashes, and commas
    in date.  RES
18 Mar 1998
  TVBOX: Made 24 bit color compatible.  RES
  GETENV2: New more portable version of getenv.  You may set up files
    with values instead of using unix environmental variables.  Should
    work on any operating system.  On unix may use either files or
    environmental variables.  RES
10 Mar 1998
  RADON: Cleaned up a bit (fixed so fractional angle steps work) and
    removed the byte only restriction.  RES
9 Mar 1998
  EQV2: Added an optional int as 5th item for a parameter line in the eqv
    file.  This forces that value to be an integer, the slider value is
    truncated to an integer using the IDL fix function.  This is useful for
    setting flags if the equation is a user defined function, or for easily
    dealing with harmonics and so on.  A possible use is where the function
    has multiple variations based on an integer flag.  An example could be a 
    circle function that returns either the top or bottom half og the circle
    depending on whether a flag value is even or odd.  RES
6 Mar 1998
  EQV2: Added x scaling which gets applied after the equation gets
    executed but before plotting.  If the same integer scale factor
    is applied to the equation to scale y then harmonics may be
    easily plotted.  RES
3 Mar 1998
  TEXT_BLOCK: New routine to make it easy to print blocks of text.
    It will print all commented lines following its call in a routine,
    until the next uncommented line is found.  Also returns the text.  RES
2 Mar 1998
  EQV2: New routine to allow interactive function plotting on current window.
    Function parameters may be varied using widget sliders.  RES
24 Feb 1998
  EXDIFF: New routine to return difference between array extremes.
    Makes range array differences much more convenient.  RES
12 Feb 1998
  IMGUNDER: Made a conversion factor double.  RES
6 Feb 1998
  JSPLOT: Set defaults for the new keywords added yesterday.  RES
5 Feb 1998
  XVIEW: Fixed the save image problem in IDL 5.  RES
  BOX2B: Attempt to fix problem with last box erase on entry.  Better
    but still has some problems.  Also sometimes get a box of size 0.  RES
  JSPLOT: Fixed XTHICK, YTHICK, CHARTHICK to work correctly.  RES
  POINTS: Added new keyword /NORMALIZED to convert size in points
    to a size in normalized coordinates.  Returns a 2 element array
    since for non-square windows the size will be different in x and y.
    Intended to allow positioning using points.  RES
4 Feb 1998
  LINT: New routine to find the intersection of two lines in the XY plane.
    The two lines are each defined by giving two points on the line.  RES
3 Feb 1998
  DMS2D: New function to convert a string with degrees, minutes, and
    seconds to degrees as a double.  Inverse of d2dms.  Only works
    for scalar values.  May leave out sec or min and sec.  RES
23 Jan 1998
  CHECK5: New routine to check if running IDL version 5 or later.  RES
  CBAR: Added CHARTHICK keyword so that now works right.  RES
  SETCOLOR: Added new keyword BRIGHTNESS=fact to allow easy change in
    brightness of color.  Works with decimal or hex colors.  RES
19 Jan 1998
  SUNALTAZI: Renamed from sunpos to avoid a conflict with a routine of
    the same name in the IDLASTRO IDL library from GSFC.  The name is
    now better than it was but may be slightly confusing since the results
    are returned in the order azi, alt but the name has altazi.  Just
    be careful.  The conflict was pointed out by James Theiler of LANL.  RES
  SUN_ZD: Renamed a routine called internally from sunpos to sunaltazi.  RES
16 Jan 1998
  FILENAME: Changed to use !version.os_family instead of
    !version.os.  Was not working for Windows because !version.os
    was win32.  RES
15 Jan 1998
  MORE: Modified to be more portable.  It was using filepath(/terminal)
    which worked ok on unix but is not portable.  It now works pretty
    well for unix and not so well for Windows.  Can't seem to print a
    backspace in Windows.  RES
  COLOR: Modified to return as text color the darkest or brightest
    value, depending on what gives best contrast.  RES
14 Jan 1998
  Following routines modified to drop the use of !d.n_colors:
    chinit, color, color_quanj, colorwarn, crossi, crossi2, ctool, eqv,
    fill_cont, hline, hori, imgline, imgscale, jsplot, ls, makevlt,
    paint, pickcolor, pltcrv, rotvlt, shade_surf2, slowplot, sprint,
    sun_colors, testcolor, topc, veri, vimgseq, ,vline webshadow,
    xced1, xmerge, xtextimg, xview.  RES
9 Jan 1998
  IMGSQZ: New routine to squeeze out colors not used greatly to make
    room for custom colors.  Moves image and color table values around
    to put the freed colors at the bottom of the color table.  RES
8 Jan 1998
  SET_SCALE: Fixed a bug where of one of the requested floating values
    (x1,x2,y1,y2) was an int it was returned as an int.  Now forces floats. RES
31 Dec 1997
  JS2WEEKDAY: New routine to return week day given Julian Second.
    May return number or name.  RES
  JD2JS: Emphasized the fact that JD starts at noon.  RES
  JS2JD: Emphasized the fact that JD starts at noon.  RES
  DATE2JD: Minor help text fix.  RES
30 Dec 1997
  SUN_COLORS: Converted color table file to a text file to be more
    portable.  RES
  COLOR: Dropped the use of getenv to find the colors file.  Now uses
    whoami to look in the source directory for colors.txt.  Also converted
    colors file to a simple text file for easier use.  Should rewrite
    someday.  RES
18 Dec 1997
  DT_TM_FROMJS: Just passed new keyword DDECIMAL=ddec on to dt_tm_mak.  RES
18 Dec 1997
  DT_TM_MAK: Added new keyword DDECIMAL=ddec to set number of decimal
    places in day of year (if given in format).  Def=none.  RES
3 Dec 1997

  TVBOX: Modified to keep box size GE 1.  RES
3 Nov 1997
  IMGNEG: Simple image processing routine that converts a color image
    to its negative.  Used as an example for the new custom PROCESS
    pull-down in XVIEW.  RES
  XHOTLIST: Added browse option to this routine.  Should now allow
    system independent directory browsing.  RES
  XVIEW: Three upgrades: (1) Added browse option to directory hotlist,
    (2) Added user defined PRINT and PROCESS pull-down menus,
    (3) Added help to the HELP button.  RES
13 Oct 1997
  WEB_BACK: A primitive but effective routine to generate a background
    image for tiling a web page.  RES
25 Sep 1997
  FILEBREAK: Fixed to work for Windows IDL.  Still no support for the Mac
    since I don't have access to one.  RES
24 Sep 1997
  SWINDOW: Handled Win95 IDL bug for draw widget Y scroll bars.  RES
22 Sep 1997
  JD2YMD: Theo Brauers made loop index long to handle long arrays of JD.  RES

  HOR: Added new keyword /OUT to plot pointers outside axes.  RES
10 Jul 1997
  DT_TM_FULL: New function to take a partial date/time string and
    expand it to a full date time string.  Useful to allow users to
    enter only times if they wish but still allow full date/times
    to be entered.  RES
8 Jul 1997
  BEST_FFT: Minor fix to avoid changing input value.  RES
1 Jul 1997
  CREATED: New routine to return a standard host, user, time stamp string.
    Ex: Created on tesla by Sterner on Tue Jul  1 14:22:15 1997
    Gives name of computer, the user name, and the time.  Intended to be
    added to file headers for reference.  RES
30 Jun 1997
  PRWINDOW: Added FACTOR=fct keyword.  RES
  PSIMG: Added new keyword, FACTOR=fct, to allow image size to be adjusted. RES
4 Jun 1997
  ROUND2: A version of round that works for big double precision numbers.
    For example, print,round2(9000000001.49999d0),form='(f20.5)' gives
    9000000001.00000, but round gives an error message and a wild value. RES
20 May 1997
  EVENT_LOG: Added new keyword ,/ADD, to add additional lines to last
    time tag in file.  This allows any number of lines under a given
    time tag.  Added /SCREEN to display text to screen too.
    Also slightly upgraded the help text.  This routine is
    really useful for logging events during processing.  For example
    errors and significant steps can be documented easily this way.  RES
15 May 1997
  PMATCH: Added new keyword, /ALL, to return indices of matches found.  RES
30 Apr 1997
  PMATCH: New routine to find a specified sequence of values in an array
    of numbers.  Does a pattern match using the where function.  RES
28 Apr 1997
  DT_TM_MAK: Very minor fix to help text.  RES
21 Apr 1997
  MAKEMS: New routine that makes an array from a starting point to
    an ending point using a maximum step size.  It steps by this size
    until within the step size and then steps the rest of the way to
    the end point.  This is useful for moving from one point to another
    but without going over a certain step size.  RES
14 Apr 1997
  POLY_FIT2: Added new keyword XFIT=xfit to allow fitted Y to be
    returned for all Xs even though only some are used to compute
    the fit.  RES
3 Apr 1997
  SELECT_INTERVALS: New routine.  From a list of short time intervals
    can select the ones that fall within a given lower and upper cutoff
    value.  Keywords to control if any or some of interval may extend
    outside range.  RES
18 Mar 1997
  RADII: Added new keyword THICKNESS=thk.  RES
17 Mar 1997
  PSTERM: Just capitalized user name.  RES
14 Mar 1997
  XVIEW: Changed 24-bit TIFF display to use color_quanj instead of
    color_quan.  color_quanj uses the JPEG image coloring algorithm
    and gives a greatly improved result over the previous method for
    some cases.  This is most noticeable where small areas are important
    but do not have enough pixels to make themselves known to the previous
    algorithm.  RES
  STATE_NAME: New function to return list of 2 letter abbreviations
    for U.S. states, or full state name given abbreviation.  Has several
    variants of the returned name.  RES
7 Mar 1997
  DIST_SCALE2: New routine, 2nd version of a distance scale.  RES
5 Mar 1997
  IMGUNDER: For PS was using pixels of size 1 point (1/72 inch).
    These looked too blocky so they were reduced to 1/2 point.  RES
27 Feb 1997
  XVIEW: Added vivid color print option.  RES
  XOPTION: Added a second submenu to allow unrelated options.  RES
24 Feb 1997
  ARCS: Added new keyword THICKNESS.  RES
21 Feb 1997
  SET_ISOXY:  Added new keyword charsize=csz.  RES
  PLOTWIN: Added new keyword charsize=csz.  RES
18 Feb 1997
  NAXES: Added new keyword /NO25 to disallow steps that are multiples
    of 2.5.  IDL does not appear to use such steps so this option
    better matches the selected IDL tick mark spacing.  RES
17 Feb 1997
  XVIEW: Added sharpening to Tools menu.  BW only.  RES
  TVSHARP: New routine to do a simple sharpening on currently displayed
    image.  BW only for now.  RES
  CONCOORD: Generalized to more than 4 points.  RES
13 Feb 1997
  SETCOLOR: New routine to allow a single color table entry to be
    set.  Input color specification may be in decimal or hex
    (web format).  RES
12 Feb 1997
  ARCS: Made default be clip to plot window.  Added new keyword
    /NOCLIP to override this.  RES
6 Feb 1997
  DT_TM_MAK: Bug fixed by Matthew Savoie, Systems Technology Associates.
    Bug showed up for the following call:
	print, dt_tm_mak(2451545L, -9.16488e+07) which gave
	1997 Feb  5 **:00:00 Wed.  Should now work.  RES
5 Feb 1997
  JSPLOT: Fixed to allow /SUN suncolors to work on color PS printer.  RES
4 Feb 1997
  SCREENTIFF: New routine to display a given TIFF image in a screen window. RES
3 Feb 1997
  DT_TM_MAK: Added two new format items: now can output month as a number
    and also day of the year.  Do help,dt_tm_mak(/help) for details.
    This gives dt_tm_fromjs the same new format items.  RES
  YMD2DN: updated to work with arrays.  RES
28 Jan 1997
  LINI: Added new keyword MAG=mag to allow mag value to be set.
    Also set default mag to 4 instead of 10.  Made active endpoint
    marker be unfilled by default.  RES
23 Jan 1997
  TNAXES: Removed the stop statement for tick spacings < 1 sec and
    changed the error message to a warning.  So now plots will still
    run.  RES
22 Jan 1997
  SUBIMG: Added exit code.  RES
17 Jan 1997
  D2DMS: New function to convert degrees to deg, min, sec text string.
    Intended for use with crossi as the x and y formatting function
    for working with lat/long.  RES
13 Jan 1997
  DT_TM_FROMCR: Added new keyword, /JS, to return date/time as JS.  RES
31 Dec 1996
  IZOOM: Corrected to handle small arrays.  The problem was this:
    Let a 4x4 array have x coordinates [0,1,2,3].  Izoom used to
    label the x axis 0 to 3 while displaying 4 pixels across.  This
    is not correct, it should label it 0 to 4.  This should now
    be fixed.  RES
  IMGUNDER: Corrected to handle small arrays.  Added new keywords
    XFRAC=xfr, YFRAC=yfr to give fraction into image to zoom.  RES
26 Dec 1996
  EVENT_LOG: Fixed a problem with the /DIFF command.  Also add new keyword
    /LOG to add time diff to log file.  RES
  GETKEY: Old routine that was dropped.  Had to bring it back since
    it's used in my librarian program.  RES
