 NAME:
  ASPECT

 PURPOSE:

  This function calculates and returns the normalized position
  coordinates necessary to put a plot with a specified aspect ratio
  into the currently active graphics window. It works on the display
  output window as well as in a PostScript output window.

   Coyote's Guide to IDL Programming: http://www.dfanning.com/

 CATEGORY:

  Graphics

 CALLING SEQUENCE:

  position = ASPECT(aspectRatio)

 INPUTS:

  aspectRatio: A floating point value that is the desired aspect
     ratio (ratio of heigth to width) of the plot in the current
     graphics output window. If this parameter is missing, an aspect
     ratio of 1.0 (a square plot) is assumed.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

  MARGIN:  The margin around the edges of the plot. The value must be
     a floating point value between 0.0 and 0.5. It is expressed in
     normalized coordinate units. The default margin is 0.15.

  WINDOWASPECT: The aspect ratio of the target window. If not provided,
     the value is obtained from the current graphics window.

 OUTPUTS:

  position: A four-element floating array of normalized coordinates.
     The order of the elements is [x0, y0, x1, y1], similar to the
     !P.POSITION system variable or the POSITION keyword on any IDL
     graphic command.

 EXAMPLE:

  To create a plot with an aspect ratio of 1:2 and a margin of
  0.10 around the edge of the output window, do this:

     plotPosition = ASPECT(0.5, Margin=0.10)
     PLOT, Findgen(11), POSITION=plotPosition

  Notice this can be done in a single IDL command, like this:

     PLOT, Findgen(11), POSITION=ASPECT(0.5, Margin=0.10)

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:

  Written by: David Fanning, November 1996.
       Added better error checking, 18 Feb 1997, DWF.
       Added WindowAspect keyword. 10 Feb 2000. DWF

 NAME:
       CENTERTLB

 PURPOSE:

       This is a utility routine to position a widget program
       on the display at an arbitrary location. By default the
       widget is centered on the display.

 CATEGORY:

       Utilities

 CALLING SEQUENCE:

       CenterTLB, tlb, [x, y, /NOCENTER]

 REQUIRED INPUTS:

       tlb: The top-level base identifier of the widget program.

 OPTIONAL INPUTS:

       x:  Set this equal to a normalized position for the center
       of the widget as measured from the left-hand side of the screen.
       The default value is 0.5 (the center)  Setting this equal to 1.0
       places the widget at the far right-hand side of the screen.

       y:  Set this equal to a normalized position for the center
       of the widget as measured from the bottom of the screen.
       The default value is 0.5 (the center) Setting this equal to 1.0
       places the widget at the top of the screen.

 KEYWORDS:

      NOCENTER:  By default, the center of the widget is positioned at the
      location specified by the x and y parameters.  If NOCENTER is set
      to a non-zero value, then the upper left corner of the widget
      is postioned at the specifed location.

 PROCEDURE:

       The program should be called after all the widgets have
       been created, but just before the widget hierarchy is realized.
       It uses the top-level base geometry along with the display size
       to calculate offsets for the top-level base that will center the
       top-level base on the display.

 COMMENT:
       Regardless of the values set for x, y and NOCENTER, the widget
       is not permitted to run off the display.

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:

       Written by:  Dick Jackson, 12 Dec 98.
       Modified to use device-independent Get_Screen_Size
            function. 31 Jan 2000. DWF.
       Added x, y, NOCENTER and run-off protection. 26 Jan 2001. BT.

 NAME:
       CHGCOLOR

 PURPOSE:
       The purpose of this routine is to allow the user to change
       the color at a particular color index. The user is able to
       mix their own color by manipulating red, green, and blue
       sliders. This routine is ideal for changing axes or background
       colors of a plot, for example. The routine works on 8-bit,
       16-bit, and 24-bit displays.

 CATEGORY:
       Widgets, Colors.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       CHGCOLOR, index

 REQUIRED INPUTS:
       INDEX: The color index to be changed. It must be a value
       between 0 and 255.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

       LABEL: Text that goes next to the color window. The default is
       "Resulting Color".

       GROUP_LEADER: The group leader for this program. When the group leader
       is destroyed, this program will be destroyed.

       NOTIFYID: A a 2 column by n row array that contains the IDs of widgets
       that should be notified when CHGCOLOR changes a color. The first
       column of the array contains widgets that should be notified. The
       second column contains IDs of widgets that are at the top of the
       hierarch in which the corresponding widgets in the first column
       are located. (The purpose of the top widget IDs is to make it
       possible for the widget in the first column to get the "info"
       structure of the widget program.) An CHGCOLOR_LOAD event will be
       sent to the widget identified in the first column. The event
       structure is defined like this:

       event = {CHGCOLOR_LOAD, ID:0L, TOP:0L, HANDLER:0L, $
          r:(!D.N_COLORS < 256), g:(!D.N_COLORS < 256), b:(!D.N_COLORS < 256)}

       The ID field will be filled out with NOTIFYID(0, n) and the TOP
       field will be filled out with NOTIFYID(1, n).

       TITLE: This is the window title. It is "Modify Drawing Color" by
       default. The program is registered with the name "chgcolor " plus
       the TITLE string. The register name is checked before the widgets
       are defined. This gives you the opportunity to have multiple copies
       of CHGCOLOR operating simultaneously. (For example, one will change
       the background color and one will change the plotting color.)

       XOFFSET: This is the X offset of the program on the display. The
       program will be placed approximately in the middle of the display
       by default.

       YOFFSET: This is the Y offset of the program on the display. The
       program will be placed approximately in the middle of the display
       by default.

 COMMON BLOCKS:
       None.

 SIDE EFFECTS:
       Color at the specified index is changed. Events are sent to widgets
       if the NOTIFYID keyword is used.

 RESTRICTIONS:
       None.

 EXAMPLE:
       To change the background color of a plot, type:

       CHGCOLOR, !P.Background

       To see a more complete example, look at the program SLICE
       in the Coyote Software Library:

          ftp://ftp.frii.com/pub/dfanning/outgoing/idl_examples

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
       Written by David Fanning, 23 April 97.
       12 May 97, Fixed a bug in the way colors were loaded when
          a tracking event occurred. DWF
       13 May 97, Added a JUST_REGISTER keyword and set it up for
          running in IDL 5.0 as a non-blocking widget.
       27 Sept 98. Fixed problems caused by IDL 5.1 color changes.
       27 Sept 98. Removed JUST_REGISTER keyword. Made widget non-blocking.

 NAME:
       COLOR24

 PURPOSE:

       The purpose of this function is to convert a RGB color triple
       into the equivalent 24-bit long integer. The 24-bit integer
       can be decomposed into the appropriate color by interpreting
       the lowest 8 bits as red, the middle 8 bits as green, and the
       highest 8 bits as blue.

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
       Written by: David Fanning, 10 JUNE 96.
       10/27/96: Added the ability to send output to PostScript. DWF
       11/4/96: Substantially rewritten to go to screen or PostScript
           file without having to know much about the PostScript device
           or even what the current graphics device is. DWF
       1/27/97: Added the RIGHT and TOP keywords. Also modified the
            way the TITLE keyword works. DWF
       7/15/97: Fixed a problem some machines have with plots that have
            no valid data range in them. DWF
       12/5/98: Fixed a problem in how the colorbar image is created that
            seemed to tickle a bug in some versions of IDL. DWF.

 CATEGORY:
       Graphics.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       colorbar = Obj_New("COLORBAR")

 INPUTS:
       All inputs to the program are via keyword parameters.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

   Background: Background color. This is the color with which the colorbar is
               erased. The default color is !P.Background.
   Bottom: Bottom color index of colors allocated to colorbar.
   Charsize: Character size of annotation. Default is 1.0.
   Color: Color of annotation and outline. Default is !P.Color.
   Font: Font to use for annotation. Default is -1, Hershey fonts.
   Format: Format of annotation. Default is "(F8.2)".
   Major: The number of major tick intervals. Default is 5.
   Minor: The number of minor tick intervals. Default is 2.
   MinusOne: Set this keyword to choose MinusOne keyword on the Congrid command
               that resizes the colorbar into the window.
   NColors: The number of colors allocated to colorbar. Default is (256 <
            !D.N_Colors).
   Neighbor: Set to indicate Nearest Neighbor sampling for Congrid. Default is
             0 (Bilinear).
   Position: The position of colorbar in normalized coordinates. Default for a
             horizontal colorbar is [0.15, 0.88, 0.85, 0.95]. Default for a
             vertical colorbar is [0.88, 0.15, 0.95, 0.85]. These defaults are
             designed for a 400 by 400 window.
   Range: The data range on colorbar. Default is [0, 255].
   TickLen: The length of tick marks. Default is -0.1
   TickV:   Locations for the tick marks in data units. This is the same as
            the [XY]TickV keyword. Default is to do what IDL would do
            normally.
   Vertical: Set this keyword if you want a vertical colorbar. Default is
             horizontal.
   XEraseBox: A five-element vector of X points (normalized) for erasing the
              colorbar plot. Normally this keyword will not have to be used.
              The program uses the plot REGION for erasing. But larger
              character sizes can result in annotation going outside the
              region enclosed by the plot. If that is the case, then use this
              keyword along with YEraseBox to specify a larger-than-normal
              erasure area. The points are sent to the POLYFILL command for
              erasing.

                 POLYFILL, xEraseBox, yEraseBox, /Normal, Color=background

   YEraseBox: A five-element vector of Y points (normalized) for erasing the
              colorbar plot.

 OBJECT METHODS:

   Draw: This procedure method draws the colorbar in the display window. The
         ERASE keyword to this method will erase the current colorbar (by
         calling the ERASE method) before drawing the colorbar in the display
         window.

               colorbar->Draw

   Erase: This procedure method erases the colorbar object in the window. It
          accomplishes this by performing a POLYFILL in the background color.
          This method is primarily useful for interactive graphics display
          devices.
               colorbar->Erase

   GetProperty: This procedure method allows one to obtain the current state
                of the object via the keyword parameters listed above.

               colorbar->GetProperty, Range=currentRange, Title=currentTitle
               Print, currentRange, currentTitle

   SetProperty: This procedure method allows one to set the properties of the
                colorbar object via the keywords described above. In addition,
                a DRAW and ERASE keyword are provided so that the colorbar can
                be immediately drawn when the new property is set.

               colorbar->SetProperty, Range=[500, 15000], /Erase, /Draw

 COMMON BLOCKS:
       None.

 SIDE EFFECTS:
       The display window is not erased first.

 RESTRICTIONS:
       None.

 EXAMPLE:
       To create a colorbar, use it, then destroy it, type:

       colorbar = Obj_New("COLORBAR", Title='Colorbar Values', Range=[0,1000],$
                  Format='(I4)')
       Window
       LoadCT, 5
       colorbar->Draw
       colorbar->SetProperty, Range=[0,500], /Erase, /Draw
       Obj_Destroy, colorbar

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
       Written by: David Fanning, Fanning Software Consulting,
                   26 November 1998.
       Added Horizontal keyword to SetProperty method and fixed problem in
       going from Vertical to Horizontal color bars. 29 Nov 1998. DWF.
       Added LoadCT method and current color table index to object.
             6 December 1998.
       Fixed a bug dealing with nearest neighbor resampling. 30 Mar 1999. DWF.
       Fixed a bug with how NCOLORS and BOTTOM keywords interacted.
             29 Aug 1999. DWF.
       10 Oct 99. Modified the program so that current plot and map coordinates
                are saved and restored after the colorbar is drawn. DWF.
       26 May 2000 Added {XY}TICKV capability to the draw method. This
                required adding TickV to the object data structure, and to the
                INIT, GetProperty and SetProperty methods.
                Changed default tick length to -0.1. DWF (and Jack Saba)

 NAME:
   COYOTE_FIELD

 PURPOSE:

   The purpose of this compound widget is to provide an alternative
   to the CW_FIELD widget offered in the IDL distribution. What has
   always annoyed me about CW_FIELD is that the text widgets do not
   look editable to the users on Windows platforms. This program
   corrects that deficiency and adds some features that I think
   would be helpful. For example, you can now assign an event handler
   to the compound widget.

 CATEGORY:

   General programming.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:

   fieldID = COYOTE_Field(parent, Title='X Size: ", Value=256, /IntegerValue)

 INPUT PARAMETERS:

   parent -- The parent widget ID of the compound widget. Required.

 INPUT KEYWORDS:

   Column -- Set this keyword to have the Label Widget above the Text Widget.
   CR_Only -- Set this keyword if you only want Carriage Return events. If
              this keyword is not set, all events are returned. No events
              are returned unless the EVENT_PRO or EVENT_FUNC keywords are used.
   DoubleValue -- Set this keyword if you want DOUBLE values returned.
   Decimal -- Set this keyword to the number of digits to the right of the decimal
              point in FLOATVALUE and DOUBLEVALUE numbers.
   Digits -- Set this keyword to the number of digits permitted in INTERGERVALUE and LONGVALUE numbers.
   Event_Func -- Set this keyword to the name of an Event Function. If this
                 keyword is undefined and the Event_Pro keyword is undefined,
                 all compound widget events are handled internally and not
                 passed on to the parent widget.
   Event_Pro -- Set this keyword to the name of an Event Procedure. If this
                keyword is undefined and the Event_Func keyword is undefined,
                all compound widget events are handled internally and not
                passed on to the parent widget.
   FieldFont -- The font name for the text in the Text Widget.
   FloatValue -- Set this keyword for FLOAT values.
   Frame -- Set this keyword to put a frame around the compound widget.
   IntegerValue -- Set this keyword for INTEGER values.
   LabelFont -- The font name for the text in the Label Widget.
   LabelSize -- The X screen size of the Label Widget.
   LongValue -- Set this keyword for LONG values.
   Row=row -- Set this keyword to have the Label beside the Text Widget. (The default.)
   Scr_XSize -- The X screen size of the compound widget.
   Scr_YSize -- The Y screen size of the compound widget.
   StringValue -- Set this keyword for STRING values. (The default.)
   Title -- The text to go on the Label Widget.
   UValue -- A user value for any purpose.
   Value -- The "value" of the compound widget.
   XSize -- The X size of the Text Widget.

 COMMON BLOCKS:

   None.

 RESTRICTIONS:

   None.

 EVENT STRUCTURE:

   All events are handled internally unless either the Event_Pro or Event_Func
   keywords are used to assign an event handler to the compound widget. By
   default all events generated by the text widget are passed to the assigned
   event handler. If you wish to receive only Carriage Return events, set the
   CR_Only keyword.

   event = { COYOTE_FIELD, $      ; The name of the event structure.
             ID: 0L, $            ; The ID of the compound widget's top-level base.
             TOP: 0L, $           ; The widget ID of the top-level base of the hierarchy.
             HANDLER: 0L, $       ; The event handler ID. Filled out by IDL.
             Value: Ptr_New(), $  ; A pointer to the widget value.
             Type:""              ; A string indicating the type of data in the VALUE field.
           }                      ; Values are "INT", "LONG", "FLOAT", "DOUBLE", or "STRING".

 CATEGORY:

   General programming.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:

   colors = Obj_New('DRAWCOLORS')

 OPTIONAL INPUT PARAMETERS:

      IDL> colors = Obj_New('DRAWCOLORS', red, green, blue, names)

   RED -- A 16-element byte vector of red values for the drawing colors.

   GREEN -- A 16-element byte vector of green values for the drawing colors.

   BLUE -- A 16-element byte vector of blue values for the drawing colors.

   NAMES -- A 16-element string vector of names for the drawing colors.

   By default, these colors are defined: Black, Magenta, Cyan, Yellow,
   Green, Red, Blue, Navy, Aqua, Pink, Orchid, Sky, Beige, Charcoal, Gray, White.

 COMMON BLOCKS:

   None.

 RESTRICTIONS:

   If you are going to use the XCOLORS method, you will need
   the XColors program from the Coyote library:

     http://www.dfanning.com/programs/xcolors.pro

   The program is set up to handle 16 drawing colors. You may
   modify the program to have a different number, but you will
   have to modify the code in two places: (1) in the drawcolors__define
   module and (2) in the INIT method.

 FUNCTION METHODS:

   COLOR24 ***************************************************************************

      Purpose:

       Turns a color triple into the equivalent 24-bit color integer value that
       can be decomposed into the color.

      Definition:

          FUNCTION DrawColors::Color24, theColor

     Parameters:

        theColor -- A 3-element vector, representing a color triple.

     Example:

        yellow = colors->GetColor("yellow")
        yellow24 = colors->Color24(yellow)


   GETCOLOR ***************************************************************************

      Purpose:

       Returns the color triple, color index number, or the
       24-bit integer representation, of the asked for color. In
       normal operation, the colors are: Black, Magenta, Cyan, Yellow,
       Green, Red, Blue, Navy, Aqua, Pink, Orchid, Sky, Beige, Charcoal,
       Gray, and White.

      Definition:

          FUNCTION DrawColors::GetColor, theColor, startIndex, INDEXNUMBER=indexnumber, $
             TRUECOLOR=truecolor, AutoDetermine=autodetermine

     Parameters:

        theColor -- A string representing the "name" of the color. If the name
              can't be resolved or found, the first color is returned.

        startIndex -- If present, and INDEXNUMBER is set, the colors are loaded at
              this index number. Otherwise, the self.startIndex is used.

     Keywords:

        AUTODETERMINE -- If this keyword is set. the state of DECOMPOSITION is
             determined (IDL 5.2 and higher) and either the INDEXNUMBER or
             TRUECOLOR keyword is set appropriately. If the decomposition state
             cannot be determined, the INDEXNUMBER keyword is set.

        INDEXNUMBER -- If this keyword is set the colors are loaded and the
             index number of the color is returned.

        TRUECOLOR -- If this keyword is set, the color triple is converted into
             a 24-bit integer before being returned. This keyword is ignored
             if the INDEXNUMBER keyword is set.

     Examples:

        drawColor = colors->GetColor("yellow")
        drawColor = colors->GetColor("blue", /Indexnumber)
        drawColor = colors->GetColor("sky", /Truecolor)


   GETCOLORS **************************************************************************

      Purpose:

       Returns the color triples, the color index numbers of, or the
       24-bit integer representations of, all the colors.

      Definition:

          FUNCTION DrawColors::GetColors, startindex, INDEXNUMBER=indexnumber, $
             TRUECOLOR=truecolor, Structure=structure

      Parameters:

        startIndex -- If present, and INDEXNUMBER is set, the colors are loaded at
              this index number. If absent, startIndex = self.startIndex.

     Keywords:

        INDEXNUMBER -- If this keyword is set the colors are loaded and the
             index numbers of all the colors are returned.

        STRUCTURE -- If this keyword is set, the return value is a structure,
             where each field of the structure is a color name and the value
             of each field is either a color triple, an index number, or a
             24-bit color value, depending upon the state of other keywords.

        TRUECOLOR -- If this keyword is set, the color triples are converted to
             24-bit integers before being returned. This keyword is ignored
             if the INDEXNUMBER keyword is set.

     Examples:

        drawColors = colors->GetColors()  ; drawColors is a 16-by-3 byte array.
        drawColors = colors->GetColors(/IndexNumber) ; drawColors is a 16-element array of color indices.
        drawColors = colors->GetColors(/TrueColor) ; drawColors is a 16-element array of 24-bit integers.
        drawColors = colors->GetColors(/IndexNumber, /Structure) ; drawColors is a structure of index numbers.
        Plot, data, Color=drawColors.yellow, Background=drawColors.charcoal


   SELECT  **************************************************************************

      Purpose:

       Puts up a blocking or modal widget dialog, allowing the user to select
       from one of the 16 predefined colors available, or to mix their own color.
       The user-defined color triple is returned as a result of the function.

      Definition:

          FUNCTION DrawColors::Select, Color=currentColor, StartIndex=startIndex, $
             Title=title, Group_Leader=groupLeader, Cancel=cancelled, TrueColor=truecolor

     Keywords:

        CANCEL -- An output keyword that will return a value of 1 if the CANCEL
             button is selected or if program operation is interrupted in any way.

        COLOR -- The index number in the color table, where the current color
             will be mixed. In other words, this color index will change when
             the program is on the display. It will be restored to its previous
             or entry color when the program exits.

        GROUP_LEADER -- The group leader for the program. This keyword *must*
             be set if calling this method from within a widget program if you
             expect MODAL program operation.

        NAME -- If this keyword is set, the return value of the function is
             the "name" of the color.

        STARTINDEX -- This is the starting index in the color table where the
             16 predetermined colors will be loaded. The original colors will
             be restored when the program exits. By default, this is set to
             !D.Table-Size - (NCOLORS + 1).

        TITLE -- The title of the program. By default: "Pick a Color"

        TRUECOLOR -- If this keyword is set, the return value of the function
            is a 24-bit eqivalent integer rather than the color triple.

     Examples:

        newColor = colors->Select()  ; A blocking widget.
        newColor = color->Select(Group_Leader=event.top, Cancel=cancelled)
        IF NOT cancelled THEN TVLCT, newColor, info.dataColor



 PROCEDURE METHODS:

   GETPROPERTY ***********************************************************************

    Purpose:

       Allows the user to obtain the current properties of the object.

    Definition:

       PRO DrawColors::GetProperty, NAMES=names, RED=red, GREEN=green, BLUE=blue, $
           STARTINDEX=startindex, NCOLORS=ncolors

     Keywords:

        NAMES -- Returns the current names of the colors as a string array.

        RED -- Returns the current red values of the colors.

 TUTORIAL:

   Here is a short tutorial in how this object can be used. Note
   that this doesn't exhaust all the possibilities.

  1. Create the object.

     IDL> colors = Obj_New("DrawColors")

  2. Find out what colors it knows about.

     IDL> colors->GetProperty, Names=colorNames
     IDL> Print, colorNames

  3. Ask for a color by name and load it at a color
     index. Draw a plot in that color.

     IDL> yellow = colors->GetColor("yellow")
     IDL> TVLCT, yellow, 200
     IDL> Device, Decomposed=0
     IDL> Plot, Findgen(11), Color=200

  4. Do the same thing, but in DECOMPOSED color.

     IDL> Device, Decomposed=1
     IDL> green = colors->GetColor("green", /TrueColor)
     IDL> Plot, Findgen(11), Color=green

  5. Find the color index number of the sky blue color.

     IDL> Device, Decomposed=0
     IDL> skyIndex = colors->GetColor("sky", /IndexNumber)
     IDL> Plot, Findgen(11), Color=skyIndex

  6. Load all 16 drawing colors at color index 32.

     IDL> colors->LoadColors, 32
     IDL> CIndex ; If them, if you have CINDEX from my library.

  7. Get a structure of colors, with each field set to
     the appropriate index number of its associated color.

     IDL> Device, Decomposed=0
     IDL> col = colors->GetColors(/IndexNumber, /Structure)
     IDL> Plot, Findgen(11), Color=col.yellow, Background=col.charcoal

  8. Allow the user to select a color from a GUI, then
     load it and use it.

     IDL> Device, Decomposed=0
     IDL> theColor = colors->Select(Cancel=cancelled)
     IDL> IF NOT cancelled THEN TVLCT, theColor, 10
     IDL> Plot, Findgen(11), Color=10

  9. Allow the user to choose 16 new drawing colors.
     (Requires my XCOLORS program.)

     IDL> colors->XColors
     IDL> theseColors = colors->Select()

 10. Let the object decide according to the device decomposition
     state whether to return an index number or 24-bit value
     for the color.

     IDL> Plot, Findgen(11), Color=colors->GetColor('beige', /Autodetermine)

 11. Call the GUI from within a widget program and load the
     new color.

     newcolor = info.colors->Select(Group_Leader=event.top, $
        Cancel=cancelled)
     IF NOT cancelled THEN TVLCT, newcolor, info.drawColor

 12. Destroy the object.

     IDL> Obj_Destroy, colors

 CATEGORY:

    Utility.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:

    ok = Error_Message(the_Error_Message)

 INPUTS:

    the_Error_Message: This is a string argument containing the error
       message you want reported. If undefined, this variable is set
       to the string in the !Error_State.Msg system variable.

 KEYWORDS:

    NONAME: If this keyword is set the name of the calling routine
       is not printed along with the message.

    TRACEBACK: Setting this keyword results in an error traceback
       being printed to standard output with the PRINT command.

    In addition, any keyword appropriate for the MESSAGE or DIALOG_MESSAGE
    routines can also be used.

 OUTPUTS:

    Currently the only output from the function is the string "OK".

 RESTRICTIONS:

    The "Warning" Dialog_Message dialog is used by default. Use keywords
    /ERROR or /INFORMATION to select other dialog behaviors.

 EXAMPLE:

    To handle an undefined variable error:

    IF N_Elements(variable) EQ 0 THEN $
       ok = Error_Message('Variable is undefined', /Traceback)

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:

    Written by: David Fanning, 27 April 1999.
    Added the calling routine's name in the message and NoName keyword. 31 Jan 2000. DWF.

 NAME:
       FSC_COLOR

 PURPOSE:

       The purpose of this function is to obtain drawing colors
       by name and in a device-decomposition independent way. The
       color names and values may be read in as a file, or 88
       color names and values are supplied from the program. These
       were obtained from the file rgb.txt, found on most X-Window
       distributions. Representative colors were chose from across
       the color spectrum. To see a list of colors available, type:
       Print, FSC_Color(/Names).

 CATEGORY:

       Graphics, Color Specification.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:

       color = FSC_COLOR(theColor, theColorIndex)

 NORMAL CALLING SEQUENCE FOR DEVICE-INDEPENDENT COLOR:

       axisColor = FSC_COLOR("Green", !D.Table_Size-2)
       backColor = FSC_COLOR("Charcoal", !D.Table_Size-3)
       dataColor = FSC_COLOR("Yellow", !D.Table_Size-4)
       Plot, Findgen(11), Color=axisColor, Background=backColor, /NoData
       OPlot, Findgen(11), Color=dataColor

 OPTIONAL INPUT PARAMETERS:

       TheColor: A string with the "name" of the color. To see a list
           of the color names available set the NAMES keyword.

           Valid names depend on the colors loaded in the program, but
           typically include such these colors as these:

              Black       Pink
              Magenta     Aqua
              Cyan        SkyBlue
              Yellow      Beige
              Green       Charcoal
              Red         Gray
              Blue        Orchid
              Navy        White

           The color WHITE is used if this parameter is absent. To see a list
           of the color names available in the program, type this:

              Print, FSC_COLOR(/Names)

       TheColorIndex: The color table index where the specified color is loaded.
           The color table index parameter should always be used if you wish to
           obtain a color value in a color-decomposition-independent way in your
           code. See the NORMAL CALLING SEQUENCE for details.

 RETURN VALUE:

       The value that is returned by FSC_COLOR depends upon the keywords
       used to call it and on the version of IDL you are using. In general,
       the return value will be either a color index number where the specified
       color is loaded by the program, or a 24-bit color value that can be
       decomposed into the specified color on true-color systems.

       If you are running IDL 5.2 or higher, the program will determine which
       return value to use, based on the color decomposition state at the time
       the program is called. If you are running a version of IDL before IDL 5.2,
       then the program will return the color index number. This behavior can
       be overruled in all versions of IDL by setting the DECOMPOSED keyword.
       If this keyword is 0, the program always returns a color index number. If
       the keyword is 1, the program always returns a 24-bit color value.

       If the TRIPLE keyword is set, the program always returns the color triple,
       no matter what the current decomposition state or the value of the DECOMPOSED
       keyword. Normally, the color triple is returned as a 1 by 3 column vector.
       This is appropriate for loading into a color index with TVLCT:

          IDL> TVLCT, FSC_Color('Yellow', /Triple), !P.Color

       But sometimes (e.g, in object graphics applications) you want the color
       returned as a row vector. In this case, you should set the ROW keyword
       as well as the TRIPLE keyword:

          viewobj= Obj_New('IDLgrView', Color=FSC_Color('charcoal', /Triple, /Row))

       If the ALLCOLORS keyword is used, then instead of a single value, modified
       as described above, then all the color values are returned in an array. In
       other words, the return value will be either an NCOLORS-element vector of color
       table index numbers, an NCOLORS-element vector of 24-bit color values, or
       an NCOLORS-by-3 array of color triples.

       If the NAMES keyword is set, the program returns a vector of
       color names known to the program.

 INPUT KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

       ALLCOLORS: Set this keyword to return indices, or 24-bit values, or color
              triples, for all the known colors, instead of for a single color.

       DECOMPOSED: Set this keyword to 0 or 1 to force the return value to be
              a color table index or a 24-bit color value, respectively.

       FILENAME: The string name of an ASCII file that can be opened to read in
              color values and color names. There should be one color per row
              in the file. Please be sure there are no blank lines in the file.
              The format of each row should be:

                  redValue  greenValue  blueValue  colorName

              Color values should be between 0 and 255. Any kind of white-space
              separation (blank characters, commas, or tabs) are allowed. The color
              name should be a string, but it should NOT be in quotes. A typical
              entry into the file would look like this:

                  255   255   0   Yellow

       NAMES: If this keyword is set, the return value of the function is
              a ncolors-element string array containing the names of the colors.
              These names would be appropriate, for example, in building
              a list widget with the names of the colors. If the NAMES
              keyword is set, the COLOR and INDEX parameters are ignored.

                 listID = Widget_List(baseID, Value=GetColor(/Names), YSize=16)

       ROW:   If this keyword is set, the return value of the function when the TRIPLE
              keyword is set is returned as a row vector, rather than as the default
              column vector. This is required, for example, when you are trying to
              use the return value to set the color for object graphics objects. This
              keyword is completely ignored, except when used in combination with the
              TRIPLE keyword.

       SELECTCOLOR: Set this keyword if you would like to select the color name with
              the PICKCOLORNAME program. Selecting this keyword automaticallys sets
              the INDEX positional parameter. If this keyword is used, any keywords
              appropriate for PICKCOLORNAME can also be used. If this keyword is used,
              the first positional parameter can be either a color name or the color
              table index number. The program will figure out what you want.

       TRIPLE: Setting this keyword will force the return value of the function to
              *always* be a color triple, regardless of color decomposition state or
              visual depth of the machine. The value will be a three-element column
              vector unless the ROW keyword is also set.

       In addition, any keyword parameter appropriate for PICKCOLORNAME can be used.
       These include BOTTOM, COLUMNS, GROUP_LEADER, INDEX, and TITLE.

 OUTPUT KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

       CANCEL: This keyword is always set to 0, unless that SELECTCOLOR keyword is used.
              Then it will correspond to the value of the CANCEL output keyword in PICKCOLORNAME.

       COLORSTRUCTURE: This output keyword (if set to a named variable) will return a
              structure in which the fields will be the known color names (without spaces)
              and the values of the fields will be either color table index numbers or
              24-bit color values.

       NCOLORS: The number of colors recognized by the program. It will be 88 by default.

 COMMON BLOCKS:
       None.

 SIDE EFFECTS:
       None.

 ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS REQUIRED:

   PICKCOLORNAME: This file can be found in the Coyote Library:

             http://www.dfanning.com/programs/pickcolorname.pro

 EXAMPLE:

       To get drawing colors in a device-decomposed independent way:

           axisColor = FSC_COLOR("Green", !D.Table_Size-2)
           backColor = FSC_COLOR("Charcoal", !D.Table_Size-3)
           dataColor = FSC_COLOR("Yellow", !D.Table_Size-4)
           Plot, Findgen(11), Color=axisColor, Background=backColor, /NoData
           OPlot, Findgen(11), Color=dataColor

       To set the viewport color in object graphics:

           theView = Obj_New('IDLgrView', Color=FSC_Color('Charcoal', /Triple))

       To change the viewport color later:

           theView->SetProperty, Color=FSC_Color('Antique White', /Triple)

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
       Written by: David Fanning, 19 October 2000. Based on previous
          GetColor program.
       Fixed a problem with loading colors with TVLCT on a PRINTER device. 13 Mar 2001. DWF.
       Added the ROW keyword. 30 March 2001. DWF.

 NAME:
   FSC_DROPLIST

 PURPOSE:

   The purpose of this compound widget is to provide an alternative
   to the DROPLIST widget offered in the IDL distribution. What has
   always annoyed me about a droplist is that you can't get the current
   "value" of a droplist easily. This compound widget makes this and
   other tasks much easier.

 COMMON BLOCKS:

   None.

 DEPENDENCIES:

   Requires ERROR_MESSAGE from the Coyote Library..

 EVENT STRUCTURE:

   An event is returned each time the droplist value is changed. The event structure
   is defined like this:

   event = { FSC_DROPLIST_EVENT, $ ; The name of the event structure.
             ID: 0L, $             ; The ID of the compound widget's top-level base.

             SELECTION:Ptr_New() $ ; A pointer to the current selection "value".
             SELF:Obj_New() }      ; The object reference of the compound widget.

 PUBLIC OBJECT METHODS:

   GetID -- A function with no arguments that returns the widget identifier
      of the droplist widget.

      droplistID = droplistObj->GetID()

   GetIndex -- A function with no arguments that returns the index
      number of the current droplist selection.

      currentIndex = droplistObj->GetIndex()

   GetSelection -- A function with no arguments that returns the current
      droplist selection.

      currentSelection = droplistObj->GetSelection()

   GetUValue -- A function with no arguments that returns the "user value"
      of the compound widget i.e., the value set with the UVALUE keyword).

      myUValue = droplistObj->GetUValue()

   GetValues -- A function with no arguments that returns the "values" or
      "selections" for the droplist.

      possibleSelections = droplistObj->GetValues()

   Resize -- A procedure that sets the X screen size of the droplist. It is
      defined like this:

      PRO Resize, newSize, ParentSize=parentSize

      The "newSize" keyword is the new X screen size. If this argument is
      missing, the screen X size of the compound widget's parent is used.
      The parentSize keyword is an output keyword that returns the X screen
      size of the compound widget's parent.

      droplistObj->Resize, 400

      Note that not all devices (e.g., X Windows devices) support droplist resizing.

   SetIndex -- A procedure that sets the current droplist selection based on
      the given index. This is equivalent to Widget_Control, droplistID, Set_Droplist_Select=newIndex

      droplistObj->SetIndex, newIndex

   SetSelection -- Whereas a regular droplist widget can only be set by index
      number, this compound widget can also be set by a "selection". The new selection
      can be any data type and corresponds to one of the "values" of the droplist.

      droplistObj->SetSelection, newSelection

 NAME:
   FSC_FIELD

 PURPOSE:

   The purpose of this compound widget is to provide an alternative
   to the CW_FIELD widget offered in the IDL distribution. One weakness
   of the CW_FIELD compound widget is that the text widgets do not
   look editable to the users on Windows platforms. This program
   corrects that deficiency and adds some features that I think
   will be helpful. For example, you can now assign an event handler
   to the compound widget, ask for positive numbers only, and limit
   the number of digits in a number, or the number of digits to the
   right of a decimal point. The program is written as a widget object,
   which allows the user to call object methods directly, affording
   even more flexibility in use. This program replaces the earlier
   programs FSC_INPUTFIELD and COYOTE_FIELD.

   The program consists of a label widget next to a one-line text widget.
   The "value" of the compound widget is shown in the text widget. If the
   value is a number, it will not be possible (generally) to type
   alphanumeric values in the text widget. String values behave like
   strings in any one-line text widget.

 CATEGORY:

   General programming.

 TYPICAL CALLING SEQUENCE:

   fieldID = FSC_FIELD(parent, Title="X Size:", Value=256, Object=fieldObject, Digits=3)

 INPUT PARAMETERS:

   parent -- The parent widget ID of the compound widget. Required.

 INPUT KEYWORDS:

   COLUMN        Set this keyword to have the Label widget above the Text widget.
                 The default is to have the Label widget in a row with the Text widget.

   CR_ONLY       Set this keyword if you only want Carriage Return events returned to
                 your event handler. If this keyword is not set, all events are returned.
                 Setting this keyword has no effect unless either the EVENT_PRO or
                 EVENT_FUNC keyword is used.

   DECIMAL       Set this keyword to the number of digits to the right of the decimal
                 point in floating point or double precision numbers. Ignored for STRING values.

   DIGITS        Set this keyword to the number of digits permitted in integer numbers.

   EVENT_FUNC    Set this keyword to the name of an event handler function. If this
                 keyword is undefined and the Event_Pro keyword is undefined,
                 all compound widget events are handled internally and not
                 passed on to the parent widget.

   EVENT_PRO     Set this keyword to the name of an event handler procedure. If this
                 keyword is undefined and the Event_Func keyword is undefined,
                 all compound widget events are handled internally and not
                 passed on to the parent widget.

   FIELDFONT     The font name for the text in the text widget.

   FRAME         Set this keyword to put a frame around the compound widget.

   LABEL_LEFT    Set this keyword to align the text on the label to the left.

   LABEL_RIGHT   Set this keyword to align the text on the label to the right.

   LABELFONT     The font name for the text in the label widget.

   LABELSIZE     The X screen size of the label widget.

   NAME          A string containing the name of the object. The default is ''.

   NOEDIT        Set this keyword to allow no user editing of the input text widget.

   NONSENSITIVE  Set this keyword to make the input text widget non-sensitive.

   POSITIVE      Set this keyword if you want only positive numbers allowed.

   SCR_XSIZE     The X screen size of the compound widget.

   SCR_YSIZE     The Y screen size of the compound widget.

   TITLE         The string text placed on the label widget.

   UNDEFINED     Set this keyword to the value to use for "undefined" values. If
                 not set, then !Value.F_NAN is used for numerical fields and a
                 NULL string is used for string fields. This applies to values
                 obtained with the GET_VALUE method or the GET_VALUE function.

   UVALUE        A user value for any purpose.

   VALUE         The "value" of the compound widget. Any type of integer, floating, or string
                 variable is allowed. The data "type" is determined automatically from the
                 value supplied with this keyword. Be sure you set the type appropriately for
                 your intended use of the value.

   XSIZE         The X size of the text widget in the usual character units.

 OUTPUT KEYWORDS:

   OBJECT        Set this keyword to a named variable to receive the compound widget's
                 object reference. This is required if you wish to call methods on the object.
                 Note that the object reference is also available in the event structure
                 generated by the widget object. Note that the object reference will be
                 necessary if you want to get or set values in the compound widget.

 COMMON BLOCKS:

   None.

 RESTRICTIONS:

   None.

 EVENT STRUCTURE:

   All events are handled internally unless either the Event_Pro or Event_Func
   keywords are used to assign an event handler to the compound widget. By
   default all events generated by the text widget are passed to the assigned
   event handler. If you wish to receive only Carriage Return events, set the
   CR_Only keyword.

   event = { FSC_FIELD_EVENT, $   ; The name of the event structure.
             ID: 0L, $            ; The ID of the compound widget's top-level base.
             TOP: 0L, $           ; The widget ID of the top-level base of the hierarchy.
             HANDLER: 0L, $       ; The event handler ID. Filled out by IDL.
             OBJECT: Obj_New(), $ ; The "self" object reference. Provided so you can call methods.
             VALUE: Ptr_New(), $  ; A pointer to the widget value.
             TYPE:""              ; A string indicating the type of data in the VALUE field.
           }

   Note that if the field is "empty", the VALUE will be a pointer
   to an undefined variable. You should check this value before you
   use it. You code will look something like this:

     IF N_Elements(*event.value) EQ 0 THEN $
         Print, 'Current Value UNDEFINED.' ELSE $
         Print, 'Current Value: ', *event.value

 GETTING and SETTING VALUES:

   Almost all the properties of the widget can be obtained or set via
   the object's GetProperty and SetProperty methods (described below).
   Traditional compound widgets have the ability to get and set the "value"
   of the compound widget identifier (e.g., fieldID in the calling
   sequence above). Unfortunately, it is impossible to retreive a variable
   in this way when the variable is undefined. In practical terms, this
   means that the undefined variable must be set to *something*. You can
   determine what that something is with the UNDEFINED keyword, or I will set
   it to !VALUES.F_NAN for numerical fields and to the null string for string
   fields. In any case, you will have to check for undefined variables before
   you try to do something with the value. For a numerical field, the code
   might look something like this:

      fieldID = FSC_FIELD(parent, Title="X Size:", Value=256, Object=fieldObject, Digits=3)
      currentValue = fieldObject->Get_Value()
      IF Finite(currentValue) EQ 0 THEN Print, 'Value is Undefined' ELSE Print, currentValue

   Additional examples are provided in the numerical example fields in Example Program below.

   Setting the value of the compound widget is the same as calling the Set_Value
   method on the object reference. In other words, these two statements are equivalent.

        fieldObject->Set_Value, 45.4
        Widget_Control, fieldID, Set_Value=45.4

   The data type of the value is determined from the value itself. Be sure you set it appropriately.

 OBJECT PROCEDURE METHODS:

   GetProperty -- This method allows various properties of the widget to be
       returned via output keywords. The keywords that are available are:

       CR_Only -- A flag, if set, means only report carriage return events.
       DataType -- The data type of the field variable.
       Decimal -- Set this keyword to the number of digits to the right of the decimal
              point in FLOATVALUE and DOUBLEVALUE numbers.
       Digits -- Set this keyword to the number of digits permitted in INTERGERVALUE and LONGVALUE numbers.
       Event_Func -- The name of the event handler function.
       Event_Pro -- The name of the event handler function.
       Name -- A scalar string name of the object.
       NoEdit -- A 1 means the widget is non-editable.
       NonSensitive -- A 1 means the widget is non-sensitive.
       NonSensitive -- Set this keyword to make the widget non-sensitive.
       Positive -- Indicates if the Positive number flag is set (1) or not (0).
       UValue -- The user value assigned to the compound widget.
       Value -- The "value" of the compound widget.

   MoveTab -- This method moves the focus to the widget identified in the "next" field,
        which must be set with the SetTabNext method. No parameters. Called automatically
        when a TAB character is typed in the text widget.

   Resize -- This method allows you to resize the compound widget's text field.
        The value parameter is an X screen size for the entire widget. The text
        widget is sized by using the value obtained from this value minus the
        X screen size of the label widget.

          objectRef->Resize, screen_xsize_value

   Set_Value -- This method allows you to set the "value" of the field. It takes
       one positional parameter, which is the value.

          objectRef->Set_Value, 5


   SetEdit -- This procedure turns editing on (value of 1) or off (value of 0).

   SetProperty -- This method allows various properties of the widget to be
       set via input keywords. The keywords that are available are:

       CR_Only -- Set this keyword if you only want Carriage Return events.
       Decimal -- Set this keyword to the number of digits to the right of the decimal
              point in FLOATVALUE and DOUBLEVALUE numbers.
       Digits -- Set this keyword to the number of digits permitted in INTERGERVALUE and LONGVALUE numbers.
       Event_Func -- Set this keyword to the name of an Event Function.
       Event_Pro -- Set this keyword to the name of an Event Procedure.
       LabelSize --  The X screen size of the Label Widget.
       Name -- A scalar string name of the object. (default = '')
       NoEdit -- Set this keyword to make the widget non-editable.
       NonSensitive -- Set this keyword to make the widget non-sensitive.
       Positive -- Set this keyword to indicate only positive numbers are allowed.
       Scr_XSize -- The X screen size of the text widget.
       Scr_YSize -- The Y screen size of the text widget.
       Title -- The text to go on the Label Widget.
       UValue -- A user value for any purpose.
       Value -- The "value" of the compound widget.
       XSize -- The X size of the Text Widget.

   SetSensitive -- This procedure turns text widget sensitivity on (value of 1) or off (value of 0).

 OBJECT FUNCTION METHODS:

      Get_Value -- Returns the "value" of the field. No parameters. Will be undefined
          if a "number" field is blank. Should be checked before using:

          IF N_Elements(objectRef->Get_Value()) NE 0 THEN Print, Value is: ', objectRef->Get_Value()

      GetID -- Returns the widget identifier of the compound widget's top-level base.
         (The first child of the parent widget.) No parameters.

      GetTextID -- Returns the widget identifier of the compound widget's text widget.
         No parameters.

 PRIVATE OBJECT METHODS:

   Although there is really no such thing as a "private" method in IDL's
   object implementation, some methods are used internally and not meant to
   be acessed publicly. Here are a few of those methods. I list them because
   it may be these private methods are ones you wish to override in subclassed
   objects.

      MoveTab -- This method moves the cursor to end of the text in the widget identified
        by the nexttab field. (This will be set with the SetTabNext method.)

      Text_Events -- The main event handler method for the compound widget. All
        text widget events are processed here.

      ReturnValue -- This function method accepts a string input value and converts
        it to the type of data requested by the user.

      Validate -- This function method examines all text input and removes unwanted
        characters, depending upon the requested data type for the field. It makes it
        impossible, for example, to type alphanumeric characters in an INTEGER field.

 EXAMPLE:

   An example program is provided at the end of the FSC_FIELD code. To run it,
   type these commands:

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:

   Written by: David Fanning, 18 October 2000. Based heavily on an earlier
      FSC_INPUTFIELD program and new ideas about the best way to write
      widget objects.
   Added LABEL_LEFT, LABEL_RIGHT, and UNDEFINED keywords. 29 Dec 2000. DWF.
   Modified the way the value is returned in the GET_VALUE method and the
      GET_VALUE function. Modified Example program to demonstrate. 30 Dec 2000. DWF.
   Added NOEDIT and NONSENSITIVE keywords, with corresponding SETEDIT and SETSENNSITIVE
      methods. 19 Jan 2001. DWF.
   Actually followed through with the changes I _said_" I made 29 Dec 2000. (Don't ask....) 13 June 2001. DWF.

 NAME:
   FSC_FILESELECT

 PURPOSE:

   The purpose of this compound widget is to provide a means
   by which the user can type or select a file name. The
   program is written as an "object widget", meaning that
   the guts of the program is an object of class FSC_FILESELECT.
   This is meant to be an example of the obvious advantages of
   writing compound widget programs as objects.

   Coyote's Guide to IDL Programming: http://www.dfanning.com/

 CATEGORY:

   General programming.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:

   filenameID = FSC_FileSelect(parent)

 INPUT PARAMETERS:

   parent -- The parent widget ID of the compound widget. Required.

 INPUT KEYWORDS:

   Event_Pro -- The event handler procedure for this compound widget.By default: "".
   Event_Func -- The event handler function for this compound widget. By default: "".

      If neither EVENT_PRO or EVENT_FUNC is defined, program events are handled internally by the compound widget.

   DirectoryName -- The initial name of the directory. By defaut: current directory.
   Filename -- The initial file name in the filename text widget.
   Filter -- The file filter. By default: "*".
   Frame -- Set this keyword for a frame around the compound widget.
   LabelFont -- The font for the label widget. By default: "".
   LabelName -- The text on the label widgt. By default: "Filename: ".
   LabelSize -- The X screen size of the label widget. By default: 0.
   MustExist -- A flag that indicates selected files must exist. By default: 0.
   NoMaxSize -- A flag to prohibit automatic text widget sizing. By default: 0.

     If this keyword is not set, the compound widget will automatically resize itself to
     the largest widget in its parent base widget. It will do this by changing the size of
     the text widgets holding the file and directory names.

   Read -- Set this keyword to have file selection for reading a file. By default: 1.
   SelectDirectory -- The default directory for file selection. In other words, this is the
     default directory for DIALOG_PICKFILE, which is accessed via the BROWSE buttons.
   SelectFont -- The font for the "Browse" button. By default: "".
   SelectTitle -- The title bar text on the file selection dialog. By default: "Select a File...".
   TextFont -- The font for the filename text widget. By default: "".
   UValue -- User value for any purpose.
   Write -- Set this keyword to open a file for writing. By default: 0.
   XSize -- The X size of the text widget holding the filename. By default: StrLen(filename) * 1.5 > 40.

 OUTPUT KEYWORDS:

   ObjectRef -- Assign this keyword to an output variable that will hold the internal object reference.
                With the object reference you can call object methods to easily change many properties of
                the compound widget.

 COMMON BLOCKS:

   None.

 RESTRICTIONS:

   Probably doesn't work correctly on VMS systems :-( If you can help, please
   contact me. I don't have a VMS system to test on.

 EVENT STRUCTURE:

   All events are handled internally unless either the Event_Pro or Event_Func
   keywords are used to assign an event handler to the compound widget. All events
   generated by the text widgets are passed to the assigned event handler.

   event = { CW_FILESELECT, $     ; The name of the event structure.
             ID: 0L, $            ; The ID of the compound widget's top-level base.
             TOP: 0L, $           ; The widget ID of the top-level base of the hierarchy.
             HANDLER: 0L, $       ; The event handler ID. Filled out by IDL.
             Basename: "", $      ; The base filename without directory specifiers.
             Filename: "", $      ; The fully qualified filename.
             Filter: ::, $        ; The currently active file filter.
             Directory: "", $     ; The name of the current file directory.
           }

 EXAMPLE:

   An example program is provided at the end of the FSC_FILESELECT code. To run it,
   type these commands:

      IDL> .Compile fsc_fileselect
      IDL> Example

   Or, if you want to obtain the object reference, type this:

      IDL> Example, theObject

   Now you can call the object's methods. For example:

      IDL theObject->SetProperty, XSize=150

 GETTING and SETTING VALUES:

   So as not to disrupt the accepted paradigm in using compound widgets, you
   can use the return value of the FSC_FILESELECT function with WIDGET_CONTROL to
   get and set the "value" of the widget.

       Widget_Control, filenameID, Set_Value='C:\RSI\IDL52\DATA\cyclone.dat'

   The program will automatically separate the file name portion of the value
   from the directory portion and put things in the correct text widgets.

   Similarly, you can get the "value" of the widget:

       Widget_Control, filenameID, Set_Value=theValue
       Print, theValue

           C:\RSI\IDL52\DATA\cyclone.dat

   The return value is the fully qualified file path to the file.

 USING OBJECT METHODS to CHANGE PROGRAM PROPERTIES:

   If you obtain the object reference, you have a great deal more control
   over the properties of the compound widget. You obtain the object reference
   by calling the function like this:

      filenameID = FSC_FILESELECT(parent, ObjectRef=theObject)

 OBJECT PROCEDURE METHODS:

   GetProperty -- This method allows various properties of the widget to be
       returned via output keywords. The keywords that are available are:

      DirectoryName -- The current directory.
      Event_Func -- The name of the event handler function for this compound widget.
      Event_Pro -- The name of the event handler procedure for this compound widget.
      Filename -- The current base filename.
      Filter -- The current file filter.
      LabelName -- The text on the label widget.
      LabelSize -- The X screen size of the label widget.
      MustExist -- A flag that indicates selected files must exist to be selected.
      Parent -- The parent widget of the compound widget.
      Read=read -- The file selection for reading flag.
      SelectTitle -- The title bar text on the file selection dialog.
      TLB -- The top-level base of the compound widget.
      UValue -- The user value of the compound widget.
      Write -- The file selection for writing flag.
      XSize -- The X size of the text widget holding the filename.

   LabelSize -- This method makes sure that the directory name and file name labels
      are the same size. Normally, this procedure is called internally. No parameters.

   MatchSize -- This method resizes the compound widget so that it is as long as the
      the longest widget in the parent base widget. This is done automatically upon
      realization unless the NOMAXSIZE keyword is set. The method aids in writing
      resizeable widget programs.

   SetProperty -- This method allows various properties of the widget to be
       set via input keywords. The keywords that are available are:

      DirectoryName -- The current directory.
      Event_Func -- The name of the event handler function for this compound widget.
      Event_Pro -- The name of the event handler procedure for this compound widget.
      Filename -- The current base filename.
      Filter -- The current file filter.
      LabelName -- The text on the label widget.
      LabelSize -- The X screen size of the label widget.
      MustExist -- A flag that indicates selected files must exist to be selected.
      Read -- The file selection for reading flag.
      SelectTitle -- The title bar text on the file selection dialog.
      UValue -- The user value of the compound widget.
      Write -- The file selection for writing flag.
      XSize -- The X size of the text widget holding the filename.

 OBJECT FUNCTION METHODS:

      GetFileName -- Returns the fully qualified filename. No parameters.

      GetTLB -- Returns the top-level base ID of the compound widget. No Parameters.

      Inspect_DirectoryName -- Inspects the directory name for correctness. Requires one positional parameter.

        directoryName -- The name of the directory from the directory text widget.
        textSelection -- The current text selection position.

        At the moment all this does is remove any blank characters from either
        end of the directory name and makes sure the last character of the directory
        name does not end in a subdirectory specifier (except for VMS).

     Inspect_Filename -- Inspects the file name for correctness. Requires one positional parameter.

        filename -- The name of the file from the filename text widget.
        textSelection -- The current text selection position.

        At the moment all this does is remove any blank characters from either
        end of the file name

 NAME:
   FSC_INPUTFIELD

 PURPOSE:

   The purpose of this compound widget is to provide an alternative
   to the CW_FIELD widget offered in the IDL distribution. What has
   always bothered me about CW_FIELD is that the text widgets do not
   look editable to the users on Windows platforms. This program
   corrects that deficiency and adds some features that I think
   would be helpful. For example, you can now assign an event handler
   to the compound widget. The program is written entirely as an object.
   A companion program, COYOTE_FIELD, has much the same functionality,
   but is written as a traditional compound widget. The point of writing
   the same program in two different ways is to give you the opportunity
   to compare and contrast the two methods. I personally think there
   is no substitute for the power of object programs. :-)

 CATEGORY:

   General programming.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:

   objectRef = FSC_INPUTFIELD(parent, Title='X Size: ", Value=256, /IntegerValue)

 INPUT PARAMETERS:

   parent -- The parent widget ID of the compound widget. Required.

 INPUT KEYWORDS:

   Column -- Set this keyword to have the Label Widget above the Text Widget.
   CR_Only -- Set this keyword if you only want Carriage Return events. If
              this keyword is not set, all events are returned. No events
              are returned unless the EVENT_PRO or EVENT_FUNC keywords are used.
   Decimal -- Set this keyword to the number of digits to the right of the decimal
              point in FLOATVALUE and DOUBLEVALUE numbers.
   Digits -- Set this keyword to the number of digits permitted in INTERGERVALUE and LONGVALUE numbers.
   DoubleValue -- Set this keyword if you want DOUBLE values returned.
   Event_Func -- Set this keyword to the name of an Event Function. If this
                 keyword is undefined and the Event_Pro keyword is undefined,
                 all compound widget events are handled internally and not
                 passed on to the parent widget.
   Event_Pro -- Set this keyword to the name of an Event Procedure. If this
                keyword is undefined and the Event_Func keyword is undefined,
                all compound widget events are handled internally and not
                passed on to the parent widget.
   FieldFont -- The font name for the text in the Text Widget.
   FloatValue -- Set this keyword for FLOAT values.
   Frame -- Set this keyword to put a frame around the compound widget.
   IntegerValue -- Set this keyword for INTEGER values.
   LabelFont -- The font name for the text in the Label Widget.
   LabelSize -- The X screen size of the Label Widget.
   LongValue -- Set this keyword for LONG values.
   Name -- A scalar string name of the object. (default = '')
   Positive -- Set this keyword if you want only positive numbers allowed.
   Row=row -- Set this keyword to have the Label beside the Text Widget. (The default.)
   Scr_XSize -- The X screen size of the compound widget.
   Scr_YSize -- The Y screen size of the compound widget.
   StringValue -- Set this keyword for STRING values. (The default.)
   Title -- The text to go on the Label Widget.
   UValue -- A user value for any purpose.
   Value -- The "value" of the compound widget.
   XSize -- The X size of the Text Widget.

 COMMON BLOCKS:

   None.

 RESTRICTIONS:

   None.

 EVENT STRUCTURE:

   All events are handled internally unless either the Event_Pro or Event_Func
   keywords are used to assign an event handler to the compound widget. By
   default all events generated by the text widget are passed to the assigned
   event handler. If you wish to receive only Carriage Return events, set the
   CR_Only keyword.

   event = { FSC_FIELD, $         ; The name of the event structure.
             ID: 0L, $            ; The ID of the compound widget's top-level base.
             TOP: 0L, $           ; The widget ID of the top-level base of the hierarchy.
             HANDLER: 0L, $       ; The event handler ID. Filled out by IDL.
             ObjRef: Obj_New(), $ ; The "self" object reference. Provided so you can call methods.
             Value: Ptr_New(), $  ; A pointer to the widget value.
             Type:""              ; A string indicating the type of data in the VALUE field.
           }                      ; Values are "INT", "LONG", "FLOAT", "DOUBLE", or "STRING".

 GETTING and SETTING VALUES:

   Almost all the properties of the widget can be obtained or set via
   the object's GetProperty and SetProperty methods (described below).
   But since traditional compound widgets have the ability to get and
   set the value of the compound widget, this capability is implemented
   as special methods.

   To get the value of the field, do this: value = objectRef->Get_Value()
   To set the value of the field, so this: objectRef->Set_Value, value, /IntegerValue

   The proper keyword should be used to set the data type of the value. If a keyword
   is not used, the data type is determined from the value itself.

 OBJECT PROCEDURE METHODS:

   GetProperty -- This method allows various properties of the widget to be
       returned via output keywords. The keywords that are available are:

       CR_Only -- A flag, if set, means only report carriage return events.
       DataType -- The data type of the field variable.
       Decimal -- Set this keyword to the number of digits to the right of the decimal
              point in FLOATVALUE and DOUBLEVALUE numbers.
       Digits -- Set this keyword to the number of digits permitted in INTERGERVALUE and LONGVALUE numbers.
       Event_Func -- The name of the event handler function.
       Event_Pro -- The name of the event handler function.
       Positive -- Indicates if the Positive number flag is set (1) or not (0).
       UValue -- The user value assigned to the compound widget.
       Value -- The "value" of the compound widget.
     Name -- A scalar string name of the object.

   MoveTab -- This method moves the focus to the widget identified in the "next" field,
        which must be set with the SetTabNext method. No parameters. Called automatically
        when a TAB character is typed in the text widget.

   Resize -- This method allows you to resize the compound widget's text field.
        The value parameter is an X screen size for the entire widget. The text
        widget is sized by using the value obtained from this value minus the
        X screen size of the label widget.

          objectRef->Resize, screen_xsize_value

   Set_Value -- This method allows you to set the "value" of the field. It takes
       one positional parameter, which is the value.

          objectRef->Set_Value, 5

       Keywords available are these to set the type of the data. If keywords
       are not used, the data type is determined from the value.

       DoubleValue -- Set this keyword if you want DOUBLE values returned.
       FloatValue -- Set this keyword for FLOAT values.
       IntegerValue --  Set this keyword for INTEGER values.
       LongValue -- Set this keyword for LONG values.
       StringValue -- Set this keyword for STRING values. (The default.)

   SetProperty -- This method allows various properties of the widget to be
       set via input keywords. The keywords that are available are:

       CR_Only -- Set this keyword if you only want Carriage Return events.
       Decimal -- Set this keyword to the number of digits to the right of the decimal
              point in FLOATVALUE and DOUBLEVALUE numbers.
       Digits -- Set this keyword to the number of digits permitted in INTERGERVALUE and LONGVALUE numbers.
       DoubleValue -- Set this keyword if you want DOUBLE values returned.
       Event_Func -- Set this keyword to the name of an Event Function.
       Event_Pro -- Set this keyword to the name of an Event Procedure.
       FloatValue -- Set this keyword for FLOAT values.
       IntegerValue --  Set this keyword for INTEGER values.
       LabelSize --  The X screen size of the Label Widget.
       LongValue -- Set this keyword for LONG values.
       Name -- A scalar string name of the object. (default = '')
       Positive -- Set this keyword to indicate only positive numbers are allowed.
       Scr_XSize -- The X screen size of the text widget.
       Scr_YSize -- The Y screen size of the text widget.
       StringValue -- Set this keyword for STRING values. (The default.)
       Title -- The text to go on the Label Widget.
       UValue -- A user value for any purpose.
       Value -- The "value" of the compound widget.
       XSize -- The X size of the Text Widget.

 OBJECT FUNCTIONS METHODS:

      Get_Value -- Returns the "value" of the field. No parameters. Will be undefined
          if a "number" field is blank. Should be checked before using:

          IF N_Elements(objectRef->Get_Value()) NE 0 THEN Print, Value is: ', objectRef->Get_Value()

      GetID -- Returns the widget identifier of the compound widget's top-level base.
         (The first child of the parent widget.) No parameters.

      GetLabelSize -- Returns the X screen size of the label widget. No parameters.

      GetTextID -- Returns the widget identifier of the compound widget's text widget.
         No parameters.

      GetTextSize -- Returns the X screen size of the text widget. No parameters.

 PRIVATE OBJECT METHODS:

   Although there is really no such thing as a "private" method in IDL's
   object implementation, some methods are used internally and not meant to
   be acessed publicly. Here are a few of those methods. I list them because
   it may be these private methods are ones you wish to override in subclassed
   objects.

      MoveTab -- This method moves the cursor to end of the text in the widget identified
        by the nexttab field. (This will be set with the SetTabNext method.)

      Text_Events -- The main event handler method for the compound widget. All
        text widget events are processed here.

      ReturnValue -- This function method accepts a string input value and converts
        it to the type of data requested by the user.

      Validate -- This function method examines all text input and removes unwanted
        characters, depending upon the requested data type for the field. It makes it
        impossible, for example, to type alphanumeric characters in an INTEGER field.

 NAME:
   FSC_PLOTWINDOW

 PURPOSE:

   The purpose of this compound widget is to create a resizeable
   "plot window" inside a larger "page window". I'm not sure it
   has any value except as a utility routine for the PostScript
   configuration object FSC_PSCONFIG__DEFINE, but it's a neat
   program anyway. :-)

 CATEGORY:

   Utility routine for FSC_PSCONFIG__DEFINE.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:

   plotwindowObject = CW_PlotWindow(parent)

 REQUIRED INPUT PARAMETERS:

   parent - The parent base widget of this compound widget.

 RETURN VALUE:

   plotwindowObject - The object reference of the compound widget.

 KEYWORDS:

   COLOR - If set, display the window in "color". This is the default on 24-bit devices.
   DEBUG - Set this keyword to turn traceback error handling on in the error handling code.
   EVENT_PRO - The event procedure for the widget. Required for events to be generated. Otherwise, all events are handled internally.
   LANDSCAPE - If set, display the page in landscape mode. Otherwise the page is display in portrait mode.
   PAGESIZE - The "pagesize" of the widget. Possible values are: "LETTER", "LEDGER", "LEGAL", "A4", and "DISPLAY".
   UNITS - A string indicating INCHES or CENTIMETER units. DEVICE units represented by a null string, "".
   UVALUE - A user value for the caller of this program.
   WINDOWCOLOR - A three-element array specifying the background window color (RGB).
   WINDOWSIZE - The size of the "window" on the page. A four-element array of normalized coordinates in the form [x0, y0, x1, y1].

 EVENT STRUCTURE:

   The event structure that is returned from this compound widget is defined like this,
   where the sizes and offsets locate the target "window" on the page in normalized units:

      event = {ID:0L, TOP:0L, HANDLER:0L, XSize:0.0, YSize:0.0, XOffset:0.0, YOffset:0.0}

 MODIFICATIONS:

   Written by David Fanning, 31 January 2000.
   Fixed a small bug that prevented it working on Macintosh computers. 26 Sept 2000. DWF.
   Added a "DISPLAY" page size, so the program can be used to position
      plots and other graphics in a display window. The "page area" will
      have the same aspect ratio is the current graphics window. 17 March 2001. DWF.

   Encapsulate - Set this keyword to select Encapsulated PostScript output. Turned off by default.
   European - Set this keyword to indicate "european" mode (i.e., A4 page and centimeter units). Turned off by default.
   Filename - Set thie keyword to the name of the PostScript file. The default is "idl.ps".
   Inches - Set this keyword to indicate sizes and offsets are in inches as opposed to centimeters. Set by European keyword by default.
   Landscape - Set this keyword to select Landscape page output. Portrait page output is the default.
   PageType - Set this keyword to the "type" of page. Possible values are:
       "Letter" - 8.5 by 11 inches. (Default, unless the European keyword is set.)
       "Legal" - 8.5 by 14 inches.
       "Ledger" - 11 by 17 inches.
       "A4" - 21.0 by 29.7 centimeters. (Default, if the European keyword is set.)
   XOffset - Set this keyword to the X Offset. Uses "System (Portrait)" defaults. (Note: offset calculated from lower-left corner of page.)
   XSize - Set this keyword to the X size of the PostScript "window". Uses "System (Portrait)" defaults.
   YOffset - Set this keyword to the Y Offset. Uses "System (Portrait)" defaults. (Note: offset calculated from lower-left corner of page.)

   In addition, the following keywords can be used:

   CANCEL -- An output keyword that will be set to 1 if the user
   chooses the Cancel button on the form. It will be 0 otherwise.

   FONTINFO -- Set this keyword is you wish to have font information
   appear on the form. The default is to not include font information.

   FONTTYPE -- Set this keyword to a named variable that will indicate
   the user's preference for font type. Values will be -1 (Hershey fonts),
   0 (hardware fonts), and 1 (true-type fonts). This keyword will always
   return -1 unless the FONTINFO keyword has also been set.

   GROUP_LEADER -- Set this keyword to a widget identifier of the widget
   you wish to be a group leader for this program.

 EXAMPLE:

   A simple sequence of using the object would look something like this:

     psObject = Obj_New("FSC_PSCONFIG")
     psObject->GUI
     psKeywords = psObject->GetKeywords()
     thisDevice = !D.Name
     Set_Plot, 'PS'
     Device, _Extra=psKeywords
     TVImage, image
     Device, /Close_File
     Set_Plot, thisDevice
     Obj_Destroy, psObject

  Note that the object can also be called from the PS_CONFIG interface:

     psKeywords = PSConfig()

 OTHER PROGRAMS NEEDED:

   The following programs are required to run this one:

     fsc_droplist.pro

       COLORTABLE: Set this keyword to a number between 0 and 40 to select one
       of the pre-selected IDL color tables for elevation shading.

       ELEVATION_SHADING: Set this keyword to put elevation shading into effect.

       EXACT: Set this keyword to a one-, two-,or three-element array to set exact axis
       scaling for the X, Y, and Z axes, respectively. If Exact is a one-element array,
       all three axes are set to the same value. For example, to set the X axis to
       exact scaling and the Y and Z axes to normal scaling, type:

           IDL> FSC_Surface, Exact=[1,0,0]

       _EXTRA: This keyword collects otherwise undefined keywords that are
        passed to the IDLgrSURFACE initialization routine.

       GROUP_LEADER: The group leader for this program. When the group leader
       is destroyed, this program will be destroyed.

       LANDSCAPE: Set this keyword if you are printing in landscape mode. The
       default is Portrait mode. The Landscape keyword on the PRINTER object
       is set, but not all printers will honor this keyword setting. If yours
       does not, set Landscape mode in the Printer Setup dialog.

       SHADED: Set this keyword to set up a shaded surface plot rather than a wire
       mesh surface, which is the default.

       TITLE:  A string used as the title of the plot.

       XTITLE: A string used as the X title of the plot.

       YTITLE: A string used as the Y title of the plot.

       ZTITLE: A string used as the Z title of the plot.

 NAME:
       FSC_WINDOW

 PURPOSE:

       This routine implements a "smart" resizeable graphics window.
       It is used as a wrapper for built-in IDL graphics procedures
       such as SURFACE, CONTOUR, PLOT, SHADE_SURF, etc. In additon,
       it can be used to display any user-written graphics procedure
       so long as that procedure follows three simple rules: (1) It
       does not open it's own graphics windows, (2) It is defined with
       no more than three positional arguments (an unlimited number
       of keyword arguments are allowed), and (3) It uses no device-
       specific commands, such as "WSet", "Device, Decomposed=1", etc.

       Keyword arguments permit the window to have its own portion
       of a color table and to be able to change the colors loaded in
       that portion of the color table. Colors are updated
       automatically on both 8-bit and 24-bit color displays. In
       addition, the window colors will "protect" themselves. I mean
       by this that the window will re-load its own colors into the
       color table when the window gains keyboard focus. This
       prevents other applications from changing the colors used to
       display data in this window. (This is an issue mainly in
       IDL 5 applications where widget applications can run
       concurrently with commands from the IDL command line.)

       Keyword arguments also permit the window to create output
       files of its contents. These files can be color and
       gray-scale PostScript, and color BMP, GIF, JPEG, PICT, PNG,
       TIFF, or JPEG files. Output can also be sent directly to
       the default printer.

 CATEGORY:

       Widgets, Graphics.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:

       FSC_WINDOW, command, P1, P2, P3

 REQUIRED INPUTS:

       COMMAND: The graphics procedure command to be executed. This parameter
       must be a STRING and the the command must be a procedure. Examples
       are 'SURFACE', 'CONTOUR', 'PLOT', etc.

 OPTIONAL INPUTS:

       P1: The first positional parameter appropriate for the graphics
           command.

       P2: The second positional parameter appropriate for the graphics
           command.

       P3: The third positional parameter appropriate for the graphics
           command.

 INPUT KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

       WBACKGROUND: The background color index for the window. Setting this color
           along with the WERASEIT keyword causes the window to be erased with
           this color. Set to !P.Background by default.

       WERASEIT: Setting this keyword "erases" the contents of the current
       graphics window before re-executing the graphics command. For example,
       this keyword might need to be set if the graphics "command" is TVSCL.
       The default is to NOT erase the display before reissuing the graphics
       command.

       _EXTRA: This keyword forms an anonymous structure of any unrecognized
       keywords passed to the program. The keywords must be appropriate
       for the graphics command being executed.

       GROUP_LEADER: The group leader for this program. When the group leader
       is destroyed, this program will be destroyed.

       WTITLE: This is the window title. It is the string "COMMAND Window (1)"
       by default, where COMMAND is the input parameter. And the number
       (1 in this case) is the window index number of the draw widget.

       WXPOS: This is the initial X offset of the window. Default is to
       position the window in the approximate middle of the display.

       WYPOS: This is the initial Y offset of the window. Default is to
       position the window in the approximate middle of the display.

       WPOSTSCRIPT: Set this keyword to 1 to include a PostScript File button under
       the Save As button. This keyword is set automatically on 24-bit display
       devices. To turn the button OFF on 24-bit devices, set the keyword value to 0.
       There is no guaranteed way to create perfect PostScript output when the program
       is run on 8-bit displays. This will depend entirely on how the "graphics command"
       is written. Hence the button is turned off automatically on 8-bit devices.

       WPRINT: Set this keyword to 1 to include a Print button under the File button.
       This keyword is set automatically on 24-bit display devices. To turn the
       button OFF on 24-bit devices, set the keyword value to 0. There is no
       guaranteed way to print output correctly when the program is run on
       8-bit displays. This will depend entirely on how the "graphics command"
       is written. Hence the button is turned off automatically on 8-bit devices.

       WXSIZE: This is the initial X size of the window. Default is 400
       pixels.

       WYSIZE: This is the initial Y size of the window. Default is 400
       pixels.

       WCOLORS: Using this keyword adds a "Colors..." button to the
       "File" menu. Set this keyword to the number of colors available
       in the window and the starting index of the first color. For example,
       to allow the window access to 100 colors, starting at color index 50
       (i.e., color indices 50 to 149), use WColors=[100, 50]. If you use the
       keyword syntax "/WColors", all the colors available will be used, not just
       one color. If the keyword is set to a scalar value greater than 1, the
       starting color index is set to 0. The default value for this keyword
       is [(!D.Table_Size, 0].

 COMMON BLOCKS:

       None.

 RESTRICTIONS:

       This program requires additional programs from the Fanning
       Software Consulting library:

       CENTERTLB.PRO
       ERROR_MESSAGE.PRO
       FSC_PSCONFIG__DEFINE.PRO
       FSC_DROPLIST.PRO
       FSC_FIELD.PRO
       FSC_FILESELECT.PRO
       FSC_INPUTFIELD.PRO
       FSC_PLOTWINDOW.PRO
       PSCONFIG.PRO
       PSWINDOW.PRO
       TVREAD.PRO
       XCOLORS.PRO

       If the "command" program requires keywords that are also keywords
       to FSC_WINDOW, then you must use the keyword twice on the command line.

 EXAMPLE:

       If the program is called with no parameters whatsoever, it will load
       example data.

       IDL> FSC_WINDOW

       To use the program with an IDL PLOT command, for example:

       IDL> FSC_WINDOW, 'PLOT', Findgen(11), Charsize=1.5, Title='Example Plot'

       To build your own graphics display command, you can do something like this.
       Here is a command program that takes an image, a column number, and a row number,
       and plots a column and row profile next to one another:

          PRO COL_ROW_PLOT, image, column, row, _Extra=extra
          ; Check parameters.
          IF N_Elements(image) EQ 0 THEN image = DIST(200)
          IF N_ELements(column) EQ 0 THEN column = 100
          IF N_Elements(row) EQ 0 THEN row = 100
          ; Set up plots.;
          !P.Multi = [0, 2, 1]
          Plot, image[column, *], Title='Row Profile', YRange=[Min(image), Max(image)], $
             XStyle=1, XTitle='At Column No: ' + StrTrim(column,2), _Extra=extra
          Plot, image[*, row], Title='Column Profile', YRange=[Min(image), Max(image)], $
             XStyle=1, XTitle='At Row No: ' + StrTrim(row,2), _Extra=extra
          !P.Multi = 0
          END

       This command program is used with FSC_WINDOW, like this:

       IDL> Demo_GetData, image, Filename='ctscan.dat'
       IDL> FSC_WINDOW, 'COL_ROW_PLOT', image, 30, 185, YTitle='Image Value'

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:

       Written by: David Fanning, Sept 2000. Based on previous XWINDOW program.
       Whoops! Left out the line to resize draw widgets on UNIX machines. Fixed. 12 Oct 2000, DWF.
       Removed support for GIF files for IDL 5.4. 18 Jan 2001. DWF.
       Beefed up documentation. 27 March 2001. DWF.

 NAME:
       GETCOLOR

 PURPOSE:
       The original purpose of this function was to enable the
       user to specify one of the 16 colors supported by the
       McIDAS color map by name. Over time, however, the function
       has become a general purpose function for handling and
       supporting drawing colors in a device-independent way.
       In particular, I have been looking for ways to write color
       handling code that will work transparently on both 8-bit and
       24-bit machines. On 24-bit machines, the code should work the
       same where color decomposition is turned on or off. The program
       now supports 88 colors.

 CATEGORY:
       Graphics, Color Specification.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       result = GETCOLOR(color, index)

 OPTIONAL INPUT PARAMETERS:
       COLOR: A string with the "name" of the color. Valid names are:
           black
           magenta
           cyan
           yellow
           green
           red
           blue
           navy
           pink
           aqua
           orchid
           sky
           beige
           charcoal
           gray
           white

           The color YELLOW is returned if the color name can't be resolved.
           Case is unimportant.

           If the function is called with just this single input parameter,
           the return value is either a 1-by-3 array containing the RGB values of
           that particular color, or a 24-bit integer that can be "decomposed" into
           that particular color, depending upon the state of the TRUE keyword and
           upon whether color decomposition is turned on or off. The state of color
           decomposition can ONLY be determined if the program is being run in
           IDL 5.2 or higher.

       INDEX: The color table index where the specified color should be loaded.
           If this parameter is passed, then the return value of the function is the
           index number and not the color triple. (If color decomposition is turned
           on AND the user specifies an index parameter, the color is loaded in the
           color table at the proper index, but a 24-bit value is returned to the
           user in IDL 5.2 and higher. This assumes the INDEXED keyword is NOT set.)

       If no positional parameter is present, then the return value is either a 16-by-3
       byte array containing the RGB values of all 16 colors or it is a 16-element
       long integer array containing color values that can be decomposed into colors.
       The 16-by-3 array is appropriate for loading color tables with the TVLCT command:

           Device, Decomposed=0
           colors = GetColor()
           TVLCT, colors, 100


 INPUT KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

       NAMES: If this keyword is set, the return value of the function is
              a 88-element string array containing the names of the colors.
              These names would be appropriate, for example, in building
              a list widget with the names of the colors. If the NAMES
              keyword is set, the COLOR and INDEX parameters are ignored.

                 listID = Widget_List(baseID, Value=GetColor(/Names), YSize=16)

       INDEXED:  If this keyword is set, the return value is always an index
              into the color table. In the absence of a color table INDEX
              parameter, the color is loaded at !P.COLOR < (!D.Table_Size-1).

       LOAD:  If this keyword is set, all 88 colors are automatically loaded
              starting at the color index specified by the START keyword.
              Note that setting this keyword means that the return value of the
              function will be a structure, with each field of the structure
              corresponding to a color name. The value of each field will be
              an index number (set by the START keyword) corresponding to the
              associated color, or a 24-bit long integer value that creates the
              color on a true-color device. What you have as the field values is
              determined by the TRUE keyword or whether color decomposition is on
              or off in the absense of the TRUE keyword. It will either be a 1-by-3
              byte array or a long integer value.

       START: The starting color index number if the LOAD keyword is set. This keyword
              value is ignored unless the LOAD keyword is also set. The keyword is also
              ignored if the TRUE keyword is set or if color decomposition in on in
              IDL 5.2 and higher. The default value for the START keyword is
              !D.TABLE_SIZE - 89.

       TRUE:  If this keyword is set, the specified color triple is returned
              as a 24-bit integer equivalent. The lowest 8 bits correspond to
              the red value; the middle 8 bits to the green value; and the
              highest 8 bits correspond to the blue value. In IDL 5.2 and higher,
              if color decomposition is turned on, it is as though this keyword
              were set.

 COMMON BLOCKS:
       None.

 SIDE EFFECTS:
       None.

 RESTRICTIONS:
       The TRUE keyword causes the START keyword to be ignored.
       The NAMES keyword causes the COLOR, INDEX, START, and TRUE parameters to be ignored.
       The COLOR parameter is ignored if the LOAD keyword is used.
       On systems where it is possible to tell the state of color decomposition
       (i.e., IDL 5.2 and higher), a 24-bit value (or values) is automatically
       returned if color decomposition is ON.

 EXAMPLE:
       To load a yellow color in color index 100 and plot in yellow, type:

          yellow = GETCOLOR('yellow', 100)
          PLOT, data, COLOR=yellow

       or,

          PLOT, data, COLOR=GETCOLOR('yellow', 100)

       To do the same thing on a 24-bit color system with decomposed color on, type:

          PLOT, data, COLOR=GETCOLOR('yellow', /TRUE)

       or in IDL 5.2 and higher,

          DEVICE, Decomposed=1
          PLOT, data, COLOR=GETCOLOR('yellow')

       To load all 88 colors into the current color table, starting at
       color index 100, type:

          TVLCT, GETCOLOR(), 100

       To add the color names to a list widget:

           listID = Widget_List(baseID, Value=GetColor(/Names), YSize=16)

       To load all 88 colors and have the color indices returned in a structure:

           DEVICE, Decomposed=0
           colors = GetColor(/Load, Start=1)
           HELP, colors, /Structure
           PLOT, data, COLOR=colors.yellow

       To get the direct color values as 24-bit integers in color structure fields:

           DEVICE, Decomposed=1
           colors = GetColor(/Load)
           PLOT, data, COLOR=colors.yellow

       Note that the START keyword value is ignored if on a 24-bit device,
       so it is possible to write completely device-independent code by
       writing code like this:

           colors = GetColor(/Load)
           PLOT, data, Color=colors.yellow

 NAME:
       GETIMAGE

 PURPOSE:
       The purpose of this function is to allow the user to open either
       regular or XDR binary image files of two or three dimensions.

 CATEGORY:
       Widgets, File I/O.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       image = GETIMAGE(filename)

 OPTIONAL INPUTS:
       filename: The name of the file to open for reading.

 OPTIONAL KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

       CANCEL: An output variable that can be set to a named variable.
       The value of the return variable will be 1 if the user clicked
       the "Cancel" button or if there was a problem reading the file.

       CATCH: Set this keyword to 0 if you wish to turn error catching OFF.

       DIRECTORY: The name of the directory the file is located in. By
       default the program looks in the "coyote" directory under the
       main IDL directory, if one exists. Otherwise, it defaults to the
       current directory.

       FRAMES: The 3rd dimension of a 3D data set. Defaults to 0.

       HEADER: The size of any header information in the file in BYTES.
       Default is 0.

       PARENT: The group leader for this widget program. The PARENT is
       required if GETIMAGE is called from another widget program in order
       to make this program a MODAL widget program.

       XDR: Set this keyword if the binary file is of XDR type.

       XOFFSET: This is the X offset of the program on the display. The
       program will be placed approximately in the middle of the display
       by default.

       XSIZE: The size of the 1st dimension of the data.

       YOFFSET: This is the Y offset of the program on the display. The
       program will be placed approximately in the middle of the display
       by default.

       YSIZE: The size of the 2nd dimension of the data.

 COMMON BLOCKS:
       None.

 SIDE EFFECTS:
       A "CANCEL" operation is indicated by a 0 return value.
       Any error in reading the file results in a 0 return value.

 RESTRICTIONS:
       None.

 EXAMPLE:
       To load the image "galaxy.dat" in the $IDL/examples/data
       directory, type:

       image = GETIMAGE('galaxy.dat', DIRECTORY=!DIR + '/examples/data', $
          XSIZE=256, YSIZE=256, Cancel=cancelled, Parent=event.top)
       IF NOT cancelled THEN TV, image

 CATEGORY:
       IDL 5 Object Graphics.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       thisColorBar = Obj_New('HColorBar')

 REQUIRED INPUTS:
       None.

 INIT METHOD KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

       COLOR: A three-element array representing the RGB values of a color
          for the colorbar axes and annotation. The default value is
          white: [255,255,255].

       NAME: The name associated with this object.

       NCOLORS: The number of colors associated with the colorbar. The
          default is 256.

       MAJOR: The number of major tick divisions on the colorbar axes.
          The default is 5.

       MINOR: The number of minor tick marks on the colorbar axes.
          The default is 4.

       PALETTE: A palette object for the colorbar. The default palette
           is a gray-scale palette object.

       POSITION: A four-element array specifying the position of the
           colorbar in normalized coordinate space. The default position
           is [0.10, 0.90, 0.90, 0.95].

       RANGE: The range associated with the colorbar axis. The default
           is [0, NCOLORS].

       TEXT: A text object. Colorbar axis annotation will use this text
           object to set its properties. The default is a text object
           using a 8 point Helvetica font in the axis color.

       TITLE: A string containing a title for the colorbar axis
           annotation. The default is a null string.

 OTHER METHODS:

       GetProperty (Procedure): Returns colorbar properties in keyword
          parameters as defined for the INIT method. Keywords allowed are:

               COLOR
               MAJOR
               MINOR
               NAME
               PALETTE
               POSITION
               RANGE
               TEXT
               TITLE
               TRANSFORM

       SetProperty (Procedure): Sets colorbar properties in keyword
          parameters as defined for the INIT method. Keywords allowed are:

               COLOR
               MAJOR
               MINOR
               NAME
               PALETTE
               POSITION
               RANGE
               TEXT
               TITLE
               TRANSFORM

 SIDE EFFECTS:
       A HColorBar structure is created. The colorbar INHERITS IDLgrMODEL.
       Thus, all IDLgrMODEL methods and keywords can also be used. It is
       the model that is selected in a selection event, since the SELECT_TARGET
       keyword is set for the model.

 RESTRICTIONS:
       None.

 EXAMPLE:
       To create a colorbar object and add it to a plot view object, type:

       thisColorBarObject = Obj_New('HColorBar')
       plotView->Add, thisColorBarObject
       plotWindow->Draw, plotView

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
       Written by David Fanning, from VColorBar code, 20 Sept 98. DWF.
       Changed a reference to _Ref_Extra to _Extra. 27 Sept 98. DWF.
       Fixed bug when adding a text object via the TEXT keyword. 9 May 99. DWF.
       Fixed the same bug when getting the text using the TEXT keyword. :-( 16 Aug 2000. DWF.
       Fixed a bug with getting the text object via the TEXT keyword. 16 Aug 2000. DWF.
       Added the TRANSFORM keyword to GetProperty and SetProperty methods. 16 Aug 2000. DWF.
       Added RECOMPUTE_DIMENSIONS=2 to text objects. 16 Aug 2000. DWF.
       Added a polygon object around the image object. This allows rotation in 3D space. 16 Aug 2000. DWF.
       Removed TEXT keyword (which was never used) and fixed TITLE keyword as per vColorBar. 19 Jan 2001. teb.

 PUBLIC METHODS:

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

 PRO LINKEDLIST::ADD, item, index, AFTER=after, BEFORE=before

   The ADD method adds a data item to the list.

   Parameters:

   item: The data item to be added to the list. Required.

   index: The location in the list where the data item is
     to be added. If neither the AFTER or BEFORE keyword is
     set, the item is added AFTER the item at the index location.
     If index is missing, the index points to the last item in
     the list. Optional.

   Keywords:

   AFTER: If this keyword is set, the item is added after the
     item at the current index.

   BEFORE: If this keyword is set, the item is added before the
     item at the current index.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

 PRO LINKEDLIST::DELETE, index, ALL=all

   The DELETE method deletes an item from the list.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

 FUNCTION LINKEDLIST::GET_COUNT

   The GET_COUNT method returns the number of items in the list.

   Return Value: The number of items stored in the linked list.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;


 FUNCTION LINKEDLIST::GET_ITEM, index

   The GET_ITEM_PTR method returns a pointer to the specified data
   item from the list.

   Parameters:

   index: The location in the list from which the data item is
     to be retrieved. If not present, the last item in the list
     is retrieved. Optional.

   Keywords:

   DEREFERENCE: Set this keyword to return the thing the pointer
      points to (i.e., the item itself.)

   Return Value: A pointer to the specified data item stored
     in the list. IF DEREFERENCE is set, the data item itself
     is returned.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

 FUNCTION LINKEDLIST::GET_NODE, index

   The GET_NODE method returns a pointer to the specified node
   from the list.

     the linked list.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

 PRO LINKEDLIST::HELP, PRINT=print

 The HELP method performs a HELP command on each item
 in the linked list.

   Keywords:

    PRINT: If this keyword is set, the PRINT command is used
      instead of the HELP command on the items in the list.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

 PRO LINKEDLIST::MOVE_NODE, nodeIndex, location, BEFORE=before

   The MOVE_NODE method moves a list node from one location to another.

   Parameters:

   nodeIndex: The location in the list of the node you are moving.
     Required.

   location: The location (index) you are moving the node to. If
     location is missing, the location points to the node at the
     end of the list.

   Keywords:

    BEFORE: If this keyword is set, the node is added to the
      list before the location node. Otherwise, it is added after
      the location node.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

 EXAMPLE:

   mylist = Obj_New("LINKEDLIST", 5)
   mylist->Add, 10

 NAME:
       LOADDATA

 PURPOSE:
       The purpose of this function is to read a selection of standard
       data sets that are found in the normal IDL distribution in the
       subdirectory $IDL_DIR/examples/data. At least 17 data sets are
       available in all categories of data. The user selects one of the
       possible data sets with the mouse.

 CATEGORY:
       File I/O.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:

       If calling from the IDL command line:

          data = LoadData()

       If calling from within a widget program:

          data = LoadData(Cancel=cancelled, Group_Leader=event.top)

       If you know which data set you want, you can load it directly:

          data = LoadData(7)

 OPTIONAL INPUTS:
       selection : The number of the data selection. Values start at 1,
           and go up to the number of data sets available (currently 17).

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
       CANCEL : An output keyword that is 1 of the use clicked the CANCEL
           button and 0 otherwise.

              data = Loaddata(Cancel=cancelled)
              IF cancelled THEN RETURN

        GROUP_LEADER: The group leader of the widget. This keyword
           is required if you wish LOADDATA to be a modal widget program.
           (Which you *always* do when calling it from a widget program.)

        IMAGES: Set this keyword if you only want to select 2D image
           data sets. Note that the selection number does *not* change
           just because fewer data sets are available in the selection
           widget.

 COMMON BLOCKS:
       None.

 SIDE EFFECTS:
       None.

 RESTRICTIONS:
       None.

 EXAMPLE:
       To load the world elevation data set:

       image = LoadData(7)

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
       Written by:  David Fanning, 5 March 1999.
       Added some additonal random data capability. 29 April 99. DWF
       Added IMAGES keyword. 31 March 2000. DWF.

 NAME:
       NORMALIZE

 PURPOSE:

       This is a utility routine to calculate the scaling vector
       required to position a graphics primitive of specified range
       at a specific position in an arbitray coordinate system. The
       scaling vector is given as a two-element array like this:

          scalingVector = [translationFactor, scalingFactor]

       The scaling vector should be used with the [XYZ]COORD_CONV
       keywords of a graphics object or model. For example, if you
       wanted to scale an X axis into the coordinate range of -0.5 to 0.5,
       you might type something like this:

          xAxis->GetProperty, Range=xRange
          xScale = Normalize(xRange, Position=[-0.5, 0.5])
          xAxis, XCoord_Conv=xScale

 NAME:
       PICKCOLOR

 PURPOSE:

       A modal dialog widget allowing the user to select
       the RGB color triple specifying a color. The return
       value of the function is the color triple specifying the
       color or the "name" of the color if the NAME keyword is set.

 CATEGORY:

       Graphics, Color Specification. See related program FSC_COLOR.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:

       color = PickColor(colorindex)

 RETURN VALUE:

       The return value of the function is a 1-by-3 array containing
       the values of the color triple that specifies the selected color.
       The color can be loaded, for example, in any color index:

           color = PickColor(240)
           TVLCT, color, 240

       The return value is the original color triple if the user
       selects the CANCEL button.

       IF the NAMES keyword is set, the return value of the function is
       the "name" of the selected color. This would be appropriate for
       passing to the FSC_COLOR program, for example.

 OPTIONAL INPUT POSITIONAL PARAMETERS:

       COLORINDEX: The color index of the color to be changed. If not
              specified the color index !D.Table_Size - 2 is used.
              The Current Color and the Color Sliders are set to the
              values of the color at this color index.

 OPTIONAL INPUT KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

       GROUP_LEADER: The group leader for this widget program. This
              keyword is required for MODAL operation. If not supplied
              the program is a BLOCKING widget. Be adviced, however, that
              the program will NOT work if called from a blocking widget
              program, unless a GROUP_LEADER is supplied.

       NAMES: Set this keyword to return the "name" of the selected color
              rather than its color triple.

       STARTINDEX: 88 pre-determined colors are loaded The STARTINDEX
              is the index in the color table where these 88 colors will
              be loaded. By default, it is !D.Table_Size - 89.

       TITLE: The title on the program's top-level base. By default the
              title is "Pick a Color".

 OPTIONAL INPUT KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

       CANCEL: A keyword that is set to 1 if the CANCEL button is selected
              and to 0 otherwise.

 COMMON BLOCKS:

       None.

 SIDE EFFECTS:

       88 pre-determined colors are loaded in the color table.
       In addition, the color index at COLORINDEX is modified while
       the program is on the display. When the program exits, the
       entry color table is restored. Thus, on 8-bit displays there
       might be some color effects in graphics windows while PICKCOLOR
       is on the display. Changes in the color table are not noticable
       on 16-bit and 24-bit displays.

 EXAMPLE:

       To specify a color for a plot in color decomposition OFF mode:

          Device, Decomposed=0
          !P.Color = !P.Color < (!D.Table_Size - 1)
          color = PickColor(!P.Color, Cancel=cancelled)
          IF NOT cancelled THEN BEGIN
              TVLCT, color, !P.Color
              Plot, data
          ENDIF

       To specify a color for a plot in color decomposition ON mode:

          Device, Decomposed=1
          color = PickColor(Cancel=cancelled)
          !P.Color = Color24(color)
          IF NOT cancelled THEN Plot, data

        To obtain the name of the selected color to pass to GetColor:

          selectedColor = PickColor(/Name)
          axisColor = FSC_Color(selectedColor, !D.Table_Size-4)

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
       Written by: David Fanning, 28 Oct 99.
       Added NAME keyword. 18 March 2000, DWF.
       Fixed a small bug when choosing a colorindex less than !D.Table_Size-17. 20 April 2000. DWF.
       Added actual color names to label when NAMES keyword selected. 12 May 2000. DWF.
       Modified to use 88 colors and FSC_COLOR instead of 16 colors and GETCOLOR. 4 Dec 2000. DWF.

 NAME:
       PICKCOLORNAME

 PURPOSE:

       The purpose of this program is to provide a blocking
       or modal widget interface for selecting a color "name".
       The program uses colors familiar to the FSC_COLOR program,
       and is often used to select a color name for passing to FSC_COLOR.

 CATEGORY:

       Graphics, Color Specification.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:

       colorName = PickColorName(startColorName)

 OPTIONAL INPUT PARAMETERS:
       startColorName: A string with the "name" of the color. Valid names
           depend on program variables, but typically include these colors:

              Black       Pink
              Magenta     Aqua
              Cyan        SkyBlue
              Yellow      Beige
              Green       Charcoal
              Red         Gray
              Blue        Orchid
              Navy        White

       The color WHITE is used if this parameter is absent.

 INPUT KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

       BOTTOM: The colors used in the program must be loaded somewhere
           in the color table. This keyword indicates where the colors
           start loading. By default BOTTOM is set equal to !D.Table_Size-NCOLORS-1.

       COLUMNS: Set this keyword to the number of columns the colors should
           be arranged in.

       FILENAME: The string name of an ASCII file that can be opened to read in
           color values and color names. There should be one color per row
           in the file. Please be sure there are no blank lines in the file.
           The format of each row should be:

              redValue  greenValue  blueValue  colorName

           Color values should be between 0 and 255. Any kind of white-space
           separation (blank characters, commas, or tabs) are allowed. The color
           name should be a string, but it should NOT be in quotes. A typical
           entry into the file would look like this:

               255   255   0   Yellow

       GROUP_LEADER: This identifies a group leader if the program is called
           from within a widget program. Note that this keyword MUST be provided
           if you want to guarantee modal widget functionality. (If you don't know
           what this means, believe me, you WANT to use this keyword, always.)

       INDEX: This keyword identifies a color table index where the selected color
           is to be loaded when the program exits. The default behavior is to restore
           the input color table and NOT load a color.

       TITLE: This keyword accepts a string value for the window title. The default
           is "Select a Color".

 OUTPUT KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

       CANCEL: On exit, this keyword value is set to 0 if the user selected
           the ACCEPT button. IF the user selected the CANCEL button, or
           closed the window in any other way, this keyword value is set to 1.

 COMMON BLOCKS:

       None.

 SIDE EFFECTS:

       Colors are loaded in the current color table. The input color table
       is restored when the program exits. This will only be noticable on
       8-bit displays. The startColorName is returned if the user cancels
       or destroys the widget before a selection is made. Users should
       check the CANCEL flag before using the returned color.

 EXAMPLE:

       To call the program from the IDL comamnd line:

         IDL> color = PickColorName("red") & Print, color

       To call the program from within a widget program:

         color = PickColorName("red", Group_Leader=event.top) & Print, color

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:

       Written by: David Fanning, 31 August 2000.
       Modified program to read colors from a file and to use more
         colors on 24-bit platforms. 16 October 2000. DWF.
       Added the COLUMNS keyword. 16 October 2000. DWF.
       Fixed a small problem with mapping a modal widget. 2 Jan 2001. DWF

 NAME:
       PROCESS

 PURPOSE:
       The purpose of this routine is to demonstrate a simple
       image processing program that runs as a "color aware"
       application. The program works on 8-bit, 16-bit, and
       24-bit displays. The image is displayed in a resizeable
       graphics window and the window contents can be saved as
       GIF or JPEG images. The application can "protect" its
       colors from other applications that change colors. The
       color protection is implemented via draw widget EXPOSE
       events or the Refresh Colors button in the menubar.

 NAME:
   PSCONFIG

 PURPOSE:

   This program is simply a function wrapper for the FSC_PSCONFIG
   object program (fsc_psconfig__define.pro). It was written so
   that it could serve as a drop-in replacement for the PS_FORM
   program it replaces. It calls the object program's graphical
   user interface as a modal widget and returns the DEVICE keywords
   collected from the form in a form that is appropriate for
   configuring the PostScript device.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:

   psKeywords = PSConfig()

 CATEGORY:

   Configuring PostScript output.

 DOCUMENTATION:

   Complete documentation for the FSC_PSCONFIG object, including
   keyword and method descriptions, and example programs using the object
   can be found on the Coyote's Guide to IDL Programming web page:

     http://www.dfanning.com/programs/docs/fsc_psconfig.html

 INPUT:

    psConfigObject -- An optional FSC_PSCONFIG object reference can be
       passed as an argument to the function. The object is not destroyed
       if passed in as an argument.

       psObject = Obj_New("FSC_PSCONFIG")
       keywords = PSConfig(psObject)

    Having the object means that you have an on-going and current record
    of exactly how your PostScript device is configured. Be sure to destroy
    the object when you are finished with it.

 KEYWORDS:

   Any keyword accepted by the FSC_PSCONFIG object can be used with
   this program. Here are a few of the most popular keywords.

   Bits_per_Pixel - The number of image bits saved for each image pixel: 2, 4, or 8. The default is 8.
   Color - Set this keyword to select Color PostScript output. Turned on by default.
   DefaultSetup - Set this keyword to the "name" of a default style. Current styles (you can easily
     create and add your own to the source code) are the following:

       "System (Portrait)" - The normal "default" system set-up. Also, "System".
       "System (Landcape)" - The normal "default" landscape system set-up.
       "Centered (Portrait)" - The window centered on the page. Also, "Center" or "Centered".
       "Centered (Landscape)" - The window centered on the landscape page. Also, "Landscape".
       "Square (Portrait)" - A square plot, centered on the page.
       "Square (Landscape)" - A square plot, centered on the landscape page.
       "Figure (Small)" - A small encapsulated figure size, centered on page. Also, "Encapsulated" or "Encapsulate".
       "Figure (Large)" - A larger encapsulated figure size, centered on page. Also, "Figure".
       "Color (Portrait)" - A "centered" plot, with color turned on. Also, "Color".
       "Color (Landscape)" - A "centered" landscape plot, with color turned on.

   Directory - Set this keyword to the name of the starting directory. The current directory is used by default.
   Encapsulate - Set this keyword to select Encapsulated PostScript output. Turned off by default.
   European - Set this keyword to indicate "european" mode (i.e., A4 page and centimeter units). Turned off by default.
   Filename - Set thie keyword to the name of the PostScript file. The default is "idl.ps".
   Inches - Set this keyword to indicate sizes and offsets are in inches as opposed to centimeters. Set by European keyword by default.
   Landscape - Set this keyword to select Landscape page output. Portrait page output is the default.
   PageType - Set this keyword to the "type" of page. Possible values are:
       "Letter" - 8.5 by 11 inches. (Default, unless the European keyword is set.)
       "Legal" - 8.5 by 14 inches.
       "Ledger" - 11 by 17 inches.
       "A4" - 21.0 by 29.7 centimeters. (Default, if the European keyword is set.)
   XOffset - Set this keyword to the X Offset. Uses "System (Portrait)" defaults. (Note: offset calculated from lower-left corner of page.)
   XSize - Set this keyword to the X size of the PostScript "window". Uses "System (Portrait)" defaults.
   YOffset - Set this keyword to the Y Offset. Uses "System (Portrait)" defaults. (Note: offset calculated from lower-left corner of page.)
   YSize - Set this keyword to the Y size of the PostScript "window". Uses "System (Portrait)" defaults.

   In addition, the following keywords can be used:

   CANCEL -- An output keyword that will be set to 1 if the user
   chooses the Cancel button on the form. It will be 0 otherwise.

   FONTINFO -- Set this keyword is you wish to have font information
   appear on the form. The default is to not include font information.

   FONTTYPE -- Set this keyword to a named variable that will indicate
   the user's preference for font type. Values will be -1 (Hershey fonts),
   0 (hardware fonts), and 1 (true-type fonts). This keyword will always
   return -1 unless the FONTINFO keyword has also been set.

   GROUP_LEADER -- Set this keyword to a widget identifier of the widget
   you wish to be a group leader for this program.

 EXAMPLE:

   To have the user specify PostScript configuration parameters, use
   the program like this:

     keywords = PSConfig(Cancel=cancelled)
     IF cancelled THEN RETURN
     thisDevice = !D.Name
     Set_Plot, 'PS'
     Device, _Extra=keywords
     Plot, findgen(11) ; Or whatever graphics commands you use.
     Device, /Close_File
     Set_Plot, thisDevice

 OTHER PROGRAMS NEEDED:

   The following programs are required to run this one:

     fsc_droplist.pro
     fsc_fileselect.pro

 NAME:
    PSWINDOW

 PURPOSE:

    This function is used to calculate the size of a PostScript
    window that has the same aspect ratio (ratio of height to
    width) as the current display graphics window. It creates
    the largest possible PostScript output window with the
    desired aspect ratio. This assures that graphics output
    looks similar, if not identical, to PostScript output.

 CATEGORY:

    Graphics.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:

    pageInfo = PSWINDOW()

 INPUTS:

    None.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

    CM: Normally the structure value that is returned from this
    function reports its values in inches. Setting this keyword
    causes the return values to be in units of centimeters.

    FUDGE: A quick way to set symetrical XFUDGE and YFUDGE factors.
    If this keyword is set to a value, XFUDGE and YFUDGE keywords are
    set to the same value.

    LANDSCAPE: Normally this function assumes a PostScript window
    in Portrait mode. Setting this keyword assumes you want
    the graphic in Landscape mode.

    MARGIN:  The margin around the edges of the plot. The value must be
    a floating point value between 0.0 and 0.5. It is expressed in
    normalized coordinate units. The default margin is 0.15.

    PAGESIZE: Set this keyword to a string indicating the type
    of PostScript page size you want. Current values are "LETTER",
    "LEGAL", and "A4". Default is "LETTER".

    PRINTER: Set this keyword if the output will be used to
    configure the PRINTER device, rather than the PS device.
    (In the PRINTER device, offsets are always calculated from
    the lower-left corner of the page and do not rotate in
    Landscape mode, as they do with the PS device.) Note that
    the PRINTER device is only able to accept these keywords
    in IDL 5.1 and higher.

    XFUDGE: Printers calculate the offset point from the printable
    edge of the paper (sometimes), rather from the corner of the paper.
    For example, on my Lexmark printer, both X and Y offsets are
    calculated from a point 0.25 inches in from the edge. This keyword
    allows you to set a "fudge" factor that will be subtracted from
    the XOFFSET that is returned to the user. This allows you to create
    output that is centered on the page. The fudge factor should be in
    the same units as the returned size and offset values.

    YFUDGE: Printers calculate the offset point from the printable
    edge of the paper (sometimes), rather from the corner of the paper.
    For example, on my Lexmark printer, both X and Y offsets are
    calculated from a point 0.25 inches in from the edge. This keyword
    allows you to set a "fudge" factor that will be subtracted from
    the YOFFSET that is returned to the user. This allows you to create
    output that is centered on the page. The fudge factor should be in
    the same units as the returned size and offset values.

 OUTPUTS:

    pageInfo: The output value is a named structure defined like
    this:

      pageInfo = {PSWINDOW_STRUCT, XSIZE:0.0, YSIZE:0.0, $
         XOFSET:0.0, YOFFSET:0.0, INCHES:0, PORTRAIT:0, LANDSCAPE:0}

    The units of the four size fields are inches unless the CM
    keyword is set.

    The output can be used to immediately configure the PostScript
    or Printer device, like this:

       Set_Plot, 'PS' ; or 'PRINTER'
       Device, _Extra=pageInfo

 RESTRICTIONS:

    The aspect ratio of the current graphics window is calculated
    like this:

       aspectRatio = FLOAT(!D.Y_VSIZE) / !D.X_VSIZE

 EXAMPLE:

    To create a PostScript output window with the same aspect
    ratio as the curently active display window, type:

     pageInfo = PSWINDOW()

 PURPOSE:

       An object for creating a progress bar.

 CATEGORY:

       Utilities

 CALLING SEQUENCE:

       progressBar = Obj_New("SHOWPROGRESS")

 INPUTS:

       parent: A widget identifier of the widget that will be the
           group leader for this program. It is *required* for modal
           operation. If missing, you are on your own. :-(

 KEYWORDS:

      CANCELBUTTON: Set this keyword if a Cancel button is desired.
      DELAY: The total time the widget should be on the display in AutoUpDate
           mode. The keyword applies only to AutoUpDate mode. Default is 5 seconds.
      STEPS: The number of steps to take in AutoUpDate mode. The keyword applies only
           to AutoUpDate mode.
      MESSAGE: The text of the label above the progress bar. Default is "Operation
           in Progress...".
      TITLE: ; The text of the top-level base title bar. Default is ""
      COLOR: The color to draw the progress bar.
      XSIZE: The XSize of the progress bar in Device coordinates. Default is 150.
      YSIZE: The YSize of the progress bar in Device coordinates. Default is 10.
      AUTOUPDATE: Set this keyword to be in AutoUpDate mode.


 PROCEDURE:
       There are two modes. In AutoUpDate mode, a delay and number of steps is
       required. The modal widget stays on the display until the total time
       exceeds the DELAY or the requested number of steps is taken. A TIMER
       widget is used to generate update events. Nothing can be going on
       concurrently in AutoUpDate mode. To enter AutoUpDate mode, type this:

          progressBar = Obj_New("SHOWPROGRESS", /AutoUpDate, Delay=2, Steps=10)
          progressBar->Start
          Obj_Destroy, progressBar

       The program will update and destroy itself automatically. (The object
       itself is not destroyed. You must do this explicitly, as in the example
       above.)

       In normal mode, the user is responsible for starting, updating, and
       destroying the progress indicator. The sequence of commands might look
       like this:

          progressBar = Obj_New("SHOWPROGRESS")
          progressBar->Start
          FOR j=0,9 DO BEGIN
             Wait, 0.5  ; Would probably be doing something ELSE here!
             progressBar->Update, (j+1)*10
          ENDFOR
          progressBar->Destroy
          Obj_Destroy, progressBar

       Normal mode gives you the opportunity to update the Progress Bar
       in a loop while something else is going on. See the example program
       at the end of this file.

       Note that the object itself is not destroyed when calling the DESTROY
       method. You must explicitly destroy the object, as in the example above.

 METHODS:

       CHECKCANCEL: This function method returns a 1 if the user has clicked
           the CANCEL button. Otherwise, it returns a 0.

          cancelled = progressBar->CheckCancel()
          IF cancelled THEN progressBar->Destroy

       DESTROY: Destroys the ShowProgress widgets. It does NOT destroy the object.

          progressBar->Destroy

       GETPROPERTY: Gets the properties that can be set in the INIT method, including
          the parent widget ID.

          progressBar->GetProperty, Steps=currentNSteps, Delay=currentDelay

       SETCOLOR: Changes the color of the progress bar.

           progressBar->SetColor, !P.Color

       SETLABEL: Changes the text on the widget label.

           progressBar->SetLabel, 'This text instead'

       SETPROPERTY: Allows the user to set the INIT parameter via keywords.

          progressBar->SetProperty, Color=244, XSize=200, Message='Please Wait...'

       START: Puts the ShowProgress bar on the display. In AutoUpDate mode, the
          widget starts to automatically update.

          progressBar->Start

       UPDATE: Updates the progress bar. Requires on argument, a number between 0
          and 100 that indicates the percent of progress bar that should be filled
          with a color.

          progressBar->Update, 50

 EXAMPLE:

       See the example program at the bottom of this file.

 RESTRICTIONS:

       In contradiction to the IDL documentation, making the parent widget
          insensitive in normal mode does NOT prevent the parent widgets from
          receiving events on my Windows NT 4.0, SP 4 system running IDL 5.2,
          IDL 5.2.1, or IDL 5.3 (beta).

       Note that if you specify a CANCEL button the Show Progress program CANNOT
       run as a MODAL widget program. Thus, user *may* be able to generate events
       in the calling program while this program is running.

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
       Written by:  David Fanning, 26 July 1999.
       Added code so that the current graphics window doesn't change. 1 September 1999. DWF.
       Added yet more code for the same purpose. 3 September 1999. DWF.
       Added a CANCEL button and made other minor modifications. 12 Oct 1999. DWF.

 REQUIRED INPUTS:

       None. Fake data will be used if no data is supplied in call.

 OPTIONAL INPUTS

       data: A 2D array of surface data.

       x: A vector of X data values.

       y: A vector of Y data values.

 OPTIONAL KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

       EXACT:  Set this keyword to get exact axis scaling.

       _EXTRA: This keyword collects otherwise undefined keywords that are
        passed to the surface initialization routine.

       GROUP_LEADER: The group leader for this program. When the group leader
       is destroyed, this program will be destroyed.

       LANDSCAPE: Set this keyword if you are printing in landscape mode. The
       default is Portrait mode. The Landscape keyword on the PRINTER object
       is set, but not all printers will honor this keyword setting. If yours
       does not, set Landscape mode in the Printer Setup dialog.

       VECTOR: Set this keyword if you want vector printing (as opposed to
       the default bitmap printing).

 NAME:
  STR_SIZE

 PURPOSE:

  The purpose of this function is to return the proper
  character size to make a specified string a specifed
  width in a window. The width is specified in normalized
  coordinates. The function is extremely useful for sizing
  strings and labels in resizeable graphics windows.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:

  thisCharSize = STR_SIZE(thisSting, targetWidth)

 INPUTS:

  thisString:  This is the string that you want to make a specifed
     target size or width.

 OPTIONAL INPUTS:

  targetWidth:  This is the target width of the string in normalized
     coordinates in the current graphics window. The character
     size of the string (returned as thisCharSize) will be
     calculated to get the string width as close as possible to
     the target width. The default is 0.25.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

  INITSIZE:  This is the initial size of the string. Default is 1.0.

  STEP:   This is the amount the string size will change in each step
     of the interative process of calculating the string size.
     The default value is 0.05.

 OUTPUTS:

  thisCharSize:  This is the size the specified string should be set
     to if you want to produce output of the specified target
     width. The value is in standard character size units where
     1.0 is the standard character size.

 EXAMPLE:

  To make the string "Happy Holidays" take up 30% of the width of
  the current graphics window, type this:

               XYOUTS, 0.5, 0.5, ALIGN=0.5, "Happy Holidays", $
        CHARSIZE=STR_SIZE("Happy Holidays", 0.3)

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:

  Written by: David Fanning, 17 DEC 96.
  Added a scaling factor to take into account the aspect ratio
     of the window in determing the character size. 28 Oct 97. DWF
  Added check to be sure hardware fonts are not selected. 29 April 2000. DWF.
  Added a pixmap to get proper scaling in skinny windows. 16 May 2000. DWF.
  Forgot I can't do pixmaps in all devices. :-( Fixed. 7 Aug 2000. DWF.

 NAME:
     TVIMAGE

 PURPOSE:
     This purpose of TVIMAGE is to enable the TV command in IDL
     to be a completely device-independent and color-decomposition-
     state independent command. On 24-bit displays color decomposition
     is always turned off for 8-bit images and on for 24-bit images.
     The color decomposition state is restored for those versions of
     IDL that support it (> 5.2). Moreover, TVIMAGE adds features
     that TV lacks. For example, images can be positioned in windows
     using the POSITION keyword like other IDL graphics commands.
     TVIMAGE also supports the !P.MULTI system variable, unlike the
     TV command. TVIMAGE was written to work especially well in
     resizeable graphics windows. Note that if you wish to preserve
     the aspect ratio of images in resizeable windows, you should set
     the KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO keyword, described below. TVIMAGE works
     equally well on the display, in the PostScript device, and in
     the Printer and Z-Graphics Buffer devices. The TRUE keyword is
     set automatically to the correct value for 24-bit images, so you
     don't need to specify it when using TVIMAGE.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:

     TVIMAGE, image

 INPUTS:
     image:    A 2D or 3D image array. It should be byte data.

       x  :    The X position of the lower-left corner of the image.
               This parameter is only recognized if the TV keyword is set.

       y  :    The Y position of the lower-left corner of the image.
               This parameter is only recognized if the TV keyword is set.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

     BACKGROUND:   This keyword specifies the background color. Note that
               the keyword ONLY has effect if the ERASE keyword is also
               set or !P.MULTI is set to multiple plots and TVIMAGE is
               used to place the *first* plot.

     ERASE:    If this keyword is set an ERASE command is issued
               before the image is displayed. Note that the ERASE
               command puts the image on a new page in PostScript
               output.

     _EXTRA:   This keyword picks up any TV keywords you wish to use.

     HALF_HALF: If set, will tell CONGRID to extrapolate a *half* row
               and column on either side, rather than the default of
               one full row/column at the ends of the array.  If you
               are interpolating images with few rows, then the
               output will be more consistent with this technique.
               This keyword is intended as a replacement for
               MINUS_ONE, and both keywords probably should not be
               used in the same call to CONGRID.

     KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO: Normally, the image will be resized to fit the
               specified position in the window. If you prefer, you can
               force the image to maintain its aspect ratio in the window
               (although not its natural size) by setting this keyword.
               The image width is fitted first. If, after setting the
               image width, the image height is too big for the window,
               then the image height is fitted into the window. The
               appropriate values of the POSITION keyword are honored
               during this fitting process. Once a fit is made, the
               POSITION coordiates are re-calculated to center the image
               in the window. You can recover these new position coordinates
               as the output from the POSITION keyword.

     MARGIN:   A single value, expressed as a normalized coordinate, that
               can easily be used to calculate a position in the window.
               The margin is used to calculate a POSITION that gives
               the image an equal margin around the edge of the window.
               The margin must be a number in the range 0.0 to 0.333. This
               keyword is ignored if the POSITION keyword is used.

     MINUS_ONE: The value of this keyword is passed along to the CONGRID
               command. It prevents CONGRID from adding an extra row and
               column to the resulting array, which can be a problem with
               small image arrays.

     NOINTERPOLATION: Setting this keyword disables the default bilinear
               interpolation done to the image when it is resized. Nearest
               neighbor interpolation is done instead. This is preferred
               when you do not wish to change the pixel values of the image.
               This keyword must be set, for example, when you are displaying
               GIF files that come with their own non-IDL color table vectors.

     NORMAL:   Setting this keyword means image position coordinates x and y
               are interpreted as being in normalized coordinates. This keyword
               is only valid if the TV keyword is set.

     OVERPLOT: Setting this keyword causes the POSITION keyword to be ignored
               and the image is positioned in the location established by the
               last graphics command. For example:

                    Plot, Findgen(11), Position=[0.1, 0.3, 0.8, 0.95]
                    TVImage, image, /Overplot

     POSITION: The location of the image in the output window. This is
               a four-element floating array of normalized coordinates of
               the type given by !P.POSITION or the POSITION keyword to
               other IDL graphics commands. The form is [x0, y0, x1, y1].
               The default is [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0]. Note that this can
               be an output parameter if the KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO keyword is
               used.

     TV:       Setting this keyword makes the TVIMAGE command work much
               like the TV command, although better. That is to say, it
               will still set the correct DECOMPOSED state depending upon
               the kind of image to be displayed (8-bit or 24-bit). It will
               also allow the image to be "positioned" in the window by
               specifying the coordinates of the lower-left corner of the
               image. The NORMAL keyword is activated when the TV keyword
               is set, which will indicate that the position coordinates
               are given in normalized coordinates rather than device
               coordinates.

               Setting this keyword will ensure that the keywords
               KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO, MARGIN, MINUS_ONE, MULTI, and POSITION
               are ignored.

 OUTPUTS:
     None.

 SIDE EFFECTS:
     Unless the KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO keyword is set, the displayed image
     may not have the same aspect ratio as the input data set.

 RESTRICTIONS:
     If the POSITION keyword and the KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO keyword are
     used together, there is an excellent chance the POSITION
     parameters will change. If the POSITION is passed in as a
     variable, the new positions will be returned in the same variable
     as an output parameter.

     If a 24-bit image is displayed on an 8-bit display, the
     24-bit image must be converted to an 8-bit image and the
     appropriate color table vectors. This is done with the COLOR_QUAN
     function. The TVIMAGE command will load the color table vectors
     and set the NOINTERPOLATION keyword if this is done. Note that the
     resulting color table vectors are normally incompatible with other
     IDL-supplied color tables. Hence, other graphics windows open at
     the time the image is display are likely to look strange.

 EXAMPLE:
     To display an image with a contour plot on top of it, type:

        filename = FILEPATH(SUBDIR=['examples','data'], 'worldelv.dat')
        image = BYTARR(360,360)
        OPENR, lun, filename, /GET_LUN
        READU, lun, image
        FREE_LUN, lun

        TVIMAGE, image, POSITION=thisPosition, /KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO
        CONTOUR, image, POSITION=thisPosition, /NOERASE, XSTYLE=1, $
            YSTYLE=1, XRANGE=[0,360], YRANGE=[0,360], NLEVELS=10

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
      Written by:     David Fanning, 20 NOV 1996.
      Fixed a small bug with the resizing of the image. 17 Feb 1997. DWF.
      Removed BOTTOM and NCOLORS keywords. This reflects my growing belief
         that this program should act more like TV and less like a "color
         aware" application. I leave "color awareness" to the program
         using TVIMAGE. Added 24-bit image capability. 15 April 1997. DWF.
      Fixed a small bug that prevented this program from working in the
          Z-buffer. 17 April 1997. DWF.
      Fixed a subtle bug that caused me to think I was going crazy!
          Lession learned: Be sure you know the *current* graphics
          window! 17 April 1997. DWF.
      Added support for the PRINTER device. 25 June 1997. DWF.
      Extensive modifications. 27 Oct 1997. DWF
          1) Removed PRINTER support, which didn't work as expected.
          2) Modified Keep_Aspect_Ratio code to work with POSITION keyword.
          3) Added check for window-able devices (!D.Flags AND 256).
          4) Modified PostScript color handling.
      Craig Markwart points out that Congrid adds an extra row and column
          onto an array. When viewing small images (e.g., 20x20) this can be
          a problem. Added a Minus_One keyword whose value can be passed
          along to the Congrid keyword of the same name. 28 Oct 1997. DWF
      Changed default POSITION to fill entire window. 30 July 1998. DWF.
      Made sure color decomposition is OFF for 2D images. 6 Aug 1998. DWF.
      Added limited PRINTER portrait mode support. The correct aspect ratio
          of the image is always maintained when outputting to the
          PRINTER device and POSITION coordinates are ignored. 6 Aug 1998. DWF
      Removed 6 August 98 fixes (Device, Decomposed=0) after realizing that
          they interfere with operation in the Z-graphics buffer. 9 Oct 1998. DWF
      Added a MARGIN keyword. 18 Oct 1998. DWF.
      Re-established Device, Decomposed=0 keyword for devices that
         support it. 18 Oct 1998. DWF.
      Added support for the !P.Multi system variable. 3 March 99. DWF
      Added DEVICE, DECOMPOSED=1 command for all 24-bit images. 2 April 99. DWF.
      Added ability to preserve DECOMPOSED state for IDL 5.2 and higher. 4 April 99. DWF.
      Added TV keyword to allow TVIMAGE to work like the TV command. 11 May 99. DWF.
      Added the OVERPLOT keyword to allow plotting on POSITION coordinates
         estabished by the preceding graphics command. 11 Oct 99. DWF.
      Added automatic recognition of !P.Multi. Setting MULTI keyword is no
         longer required. 18 Nov 99. DWF.
      Added NOINTERPOLATION keyword so that nearest neighbor interpolation
         is performed rather than bilinear. 3 Dec 99. DWF
      Changed ON_ERROR condition from 1 to 2. 19 Dec 99. DWF.
      Added Craig Markwardt's CMCongrid program and removed RSI's. 24 Feb 2000. DWF.
      Added HALF_HALF keyword to support CMCONGRID. 24 Feb 2000. DWF.
      Fixed a small problem with image start position by adding ROUND function. 19 March 2000. DWF.
      Updated the PRINTER device code to take advantage of available keywords. 2 April 2000. DWF.
      Reorganized the code to handle 24-bit images on 8-bit displays better. 2 April 2000. DWF.
      Added BACKGROUND keyword. 20 April 2000. DWF.
      Fixed a small problem in where the ERASE was occuring. 6 May 2000. DWF.
      Rearranged the PLOT part of code to occur before decomposition state
         is changed to fix Background color bug in multiple plots. 23 Sept 2000. DWF.
      Removed MULTI keyword, which is no longer needed. 23 Sept 2000. DWF.
      Fixed a small problem with handling images that are slices from 3D image cubes. 5 Oct 2000. DWF.
      Added fix for brain-dead Macs from Ben Tupper that restores Macs ability to display images. 8 June 2001. DWF.

 NAME:
       TVREAD

 PURPOSE:

       To get accurate screen dumps with the IDL command TVRD on 24-bit
       PC and Macintosh computers, you have to be sure to set color
       decomposition on. This program adds that capability automatically.
       In addition, the program will optionally write BMP, GIF, JPEG,
       PICT, PNG, and TIFF color image files of the screen dump.

       Graphics

 CALLING SEQUENCE:

       image = TVREAD(xstart, ystart, ncols, nrows)

       The returned image will be a 2D image on 8-bit systems and
       a 24-bit pixel interleaved true-color image on 24-bit systems.
       A -1 will be returned if a file output keyword is used (e.g., JPEG, TIFF, etc.).

 OPTIONAL INPUTS:

       XSTART -- The starting column index.  By default, 0.

       YSTART -- The starting row index. By default, 0.

       NCOLS -- The number of columns to read. By default, !D.X_Size - XSTART

       NROWS -- The number of rows to read. By default, !D.Y_Size - YSTART.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

       BMP -- Set this keyword to write the screen dump as a color BMP file.

       COLORS -- If a 24-bit image has to be quantized, this will set the number
          of colors in the output image. Set to 256 by default. Applies to BMP,
          GIF, PICT, and PNG formats written from 24-bit displays.(See the
          COLOR_QUAN documentation for details.)

       CUBE -- If this keyword is set to a value between 2 and 6 the color
          quantization will use a cubic method of quantization. Applies to BMP,
          GIF, PICT, and PNG formats written from 24-bit displays.(See the
          COLOR_QUAN documentation for details.)

       DITHER -- If this keyword is set the quantized image will be dithered.
          Applies to BMP, GIF, PICT, and PNG formats written from 24-bit displays.
          (See the COLOR_QUAN documentation for details.)

           dialog that asks you to name the output file. This keyword should be
           set, for example, if you are processing screens in batch mode.

       PICT -- Set this keyword to write the screen dump as a color PICT file.

       PNG -- Set this keyword to write the screen dump as a color PNG file.

       TIFF -- Set this keyword to write the screen dump as a color TIFF file.

       QUALITY -- This keyword sets the amount of compression for JPEG images.
           It should be set to a value between 0 and 100. It is set to 75 by default.

 NAME:
     TVSCALE

 PURPOSE:
     This purpose of TVSCALE is to enable the TVSCL command in IDL
     to be a completely device-independent and color-decomposition-
     state independent command. On 24-bit displays color decomposition
     is always turned off for 8-bit images and on for 24-bit images.
     The color decomposition state is restored for those versions of
     IDL that support it (> 5.2). Moreover, TVSCALE adds features
     that TVSCL lacks. For example, images can be positioned in windows
     using the POSITION keyword like other IDL graphics commands.
     TVSCALE also supports the !P.MULTI system variable, unlike the
     TVSCL command. TVSCALE was written to work especially well in
     resizeable graphics windows. Note that if you wish to preserve
     the aspect ratio of images in resizeable windows, you should set
     the KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO keyword, described below. TVSCALE works
     equally well on the display, in the PostScript device, and in
     the Printer and Z-Graphics Buffer devices. The TRUE keyword is
     set automatically to the correct value for 24-bit images, so you
     don't need to specify it when using TVSCALE. In addition, you can
     use the TOP and BOTTOM keywords to define a particular set of
     number to scale the data to. The algorithm used is this:

         TV. BytScl(image, TOP=top-bottom) + bottom

     Note that if you scale the image between 100 and 200, that
     there are 101 possible pixel values. So the proper way to
     load colors would be like this:

       LoadCT, NColors=101, Bottom=100
       TVSCALE, image, Top=200, Bottom=100

     Alternatively, you could use the NCOLORS keyword:

       LoadCT, NColors=100, Bottom=100
       TVSCALE, image, NColors=100, Bottom=100

 CATEGORY:
     Graphics display.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:

     TVSCALE, image

 INPUTS:
     image:    A 2D or 3D image array. It does not have to be byte data.

       x  :    The X position of the lower-left corner of the image.
               This parameter is only recognized if the TVSCL keyword is set.

       y  :    The Y position of the lower-left corner of the image.
               This parameter is only recognized if the TVSCL keyword is set.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
     BACKGROUND:   This keyword specifies the background color. Note that
               the keyword ONLY has effect if the ERASE keyword is also
               set or !P.MULTI is set to multiple plots and TVSCALE is
               used to place the *first* plot.

     BOTTOM:   The image is scaled so that all displayed pixels have values
               greater than or equal to BOTTOM and less than or equal to TOP.
               The value of BOTTOM is 0 by default.

     ERASE:    If this keyword is set an ERASE command is issued
               before the image is displayed. Note that the ERASE
               command puts the image on a new page in PostScript
               output.

     _EXTRA:   This keyword picks up any TV keywords you wish to use.

     HALF_HALF: If set, will tell CONGRID to extrapolate a *half* row
               and column on either side, rather than the default of
               one full row/column at the ends of the array.  If you
               are interpolating images with few rows, then the
               output will be more consistent with this technique.
               This keyword is intended as a replacement for
               MINUS_ONE, and both keywords probably should not be
               used in the same call to CONGRID.

     KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO: Normally, the image will be resized to fit the
               specified position in the window. If you prefer, you can
               force the image to maintain its aspect ratio in the window
               (although not its natural size) by setting this keyword.
               The image width is fitted first. If, after setting the
               image width, the image height is too big for the window,
               then the image height is fitted into the window. The
               appropriate values of the POSITION keyword are honored
               during this fitting process. Once a fit is made, the
               POSITION coordiates are re-calculated to center the image
               in the window. You can recover these new position coordinates
               as the output from the POSITION keyword.

     MARGIN:   A single value, expressed as a normalized coordinate, that
               can easily be used to calculate a position in the window.
               The margin is used to calculate a POSITION that gives
               the image an equal margin around the edge of the window.
               The margin must be a number in the range 0.0 to 0.333. This
               keyword is ignored if the POSITION keyword is used.

     MAXVALUE: The data is linearly scaled between the MIN and MAX values,
               if they are provided. MAX is set to MAX(image) by default.

     MINVALUE: The data is linearly scaled between the MIN and MAX values,
               if they are provided. MIN is set to MIN(image) by default.

     MINUS_ONE: The value of this keyword is passed along to the CONGRID
               command. It prevents CONGRID from adding an extra row and
               column to the resulting array, which can be a problem with
               small image arrays.

     NCOLORS:  If this keyword is supplied, the TOP keyword is ignored and
               the TOP keyword is set equal to BOTTOM + NCOLORS - 1. This
               keyword is provided to make TVSCALE easier to use with the
               color-loading programs such as LOADCT:

                  LoadCT, 5, NColors=100, Bottom=100
                  TVScale, image, NColors=100, Bottom=100

     NOINTERPOLATION: Setting this keyword disables the default bilinear
               interpolation done to the image when it is resized. Nearest
               neighbor interpolation is done instead. This is preferred
               when you do not wish to change the pixel values of the image.

     NORMAL:   Setting this keyword means image position coordinates x and y
               are interpreted as being in normalized coordinates. This keyword
               is only valid if the TVSCL keyword is set.

     OVERPLOT: Setting this keyword causes the POSITION keyword to be ignored
               and the image is positioned in the location established by the
               last graphics command. For example:

                    Plot, Findgen(11), Position=[0.1, 0.3, 0.8, 0.95]
                    TVScale, image, /Overplot

     POSITION: The location of the image in the output window. This is
               a four-element floating array of normalized coordinates of
               the type given by !P.POSITION or the POSITION keyword to
               other IDL graphics commands. The form is [x0, y0, x1, y1].
               The default is [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0]. Note that this can
               be an output parameter if the KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO keyword is
               used.

     TOP:      The image is scaled so that all displayed pixels have values
               greater than or equal to BOTTOM and less than or equal to TOP.
               The value of TOP is !D.Table_Size by default.

     TVSCL:    Setting this keyword makes the TVIMAGE command work much
               like the TVSCL command, although better. That is to say, it
               will still set the correct DECOMPOSED state depending upon
               the kind of image to be displayed (8-bit or 24-bit). It will
               also allow the image to be "positioned" in the window by
               specifying the coordinates of the lower-left corner of the
               image. The NORMAL keyword is activated when the TV keyword
               is set, which will indicate that the position coordinates
               are given in normalized coordinates rather than device
               coordinates.

               Setting this keyword will ensure that the keywords
               KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO, MARGIN, MINUS_ONE, MULTI, and POSITION
               are ignored.

 OUTPUTS:
     None.

 SIDE EFFECTS:
     Unless the KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO keyword is set, the displayed image
     may not have the same aspect ratio as the input data set.

 RESTRICTIONS:
     If the POSITION keyword and the KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO keyword are
     used together, there is an excellent chance the POSITION
     parameters will change. If the POSITION is passed in as a
     variable, the new positions will be returned as an output parameter.

     If the image is 2D then color decomposition is turned OFF
     for the current graphics device (i.e., DEVICE, DECOMPOSED=0).

     If outputting to the PRINTER device, the aspect ratio of the image
     is always maintained and the POSITION coordinates are ignored.
     The image always printed in portrait mode.

 EXAMPLE:
     To display an image with a contour plot on top of it, type:

        filename = FILEPATH(SUBDIR=['examples','data'], 'worldelv.dat')
        image = BYTARR(360,360)
        OPENR, lun, filename, /GET_LUN
        READU, lun, image
        FREE_LUN, lun

        thisPosition = [0.1, 0.1, 0.9, 0.9]
        TVSCALE, image, POSITION=thisPosition, /KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO
        CONTOUR, image, POSITION=thisPosition, /NOERASE, XSTYLE=1, $
            YSTYLE=1, XRANGE=[0,360], YRANGE=[0,360], NLEVELS=10

 PURPOSE:
       The purpose of this program is to create a vertical
       colorbar object to be used in conjunction with other
       IDL 5 graphics objects.

 CATEGORY:
       IDL 5 Object Graphics.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       thisColorBar = Obj_New('VColorBar')

 REQUIRED INPUTS:
       None.

 INIT METHOD KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

       COLOR: A three-element array representing the RGB values of a color
          for the colorbar axes and annotation. The default value is
          white: [255,255,255].

       NAME: The name associated with this object.

       NCOLORS: The number of colors associated with the colorbar. The
          default is 256.

       MAJOR: The number of major tick divisions on the colorbar axes.
          The default is 5.

       MINOR: The number of minor tick marks on the colorbar axes.
          The default is 4.

       PALETTE: A palette object for the colorbar. The default palette
           is a gray-scale palette object.

       POSITION: A four-element array specifying the position of the
           colorbar in normalized coordinate space. The default position
           is [0.90, 0.10, 0.95, 0.90].

       RANGE: The range associated with the colorbar axis. The default
           is [0, NCOLORS].

       TITLE: A string containing a title for the colorbar axis
           annotation. The default is a null string.

 OTHER METHODS:

       GetProperty (Procedure): Returns colorbar properties in keyword
          parameters as defined for the INIT method. Keywords allowed are:

               COLOR
               MAJOR
               MINOR
               NAME
               PALETTE
               POSITION
               RANGE
               TITLE
               TRANSFORM

       SetProperty (Procedure): Sets colorbar properties in keyword
          parameters as defined for the INIT method. Keywords allowed are:

               COLOR
               NAME
               MAJOR
               MINOR
               PALETTE
               POSITION
               RANGE
               TITLE
               TRANSFORM

 SIDE EFFECTS:
       A VCOLORBAR object is created. The colorbar INHERITS IDLgrMODEL.
       Thus, all IDLgrMODEL methods and keywords can also be used. It is
       the model that is selected in a selection event, since the SELECT_TARGET
       keyword is set for the model.

 RESTRICTIONS:
       None.

 EXAMPLE:
       To create a colorbar object and add it to a plot view object, type:

       thisColorBarObject = Obj_New('VColorBar')
       plotView->Add, thisColorBarObject
       plotWindow->Draw, plotView

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
       Written by David Fanning, 19 June 97.
       Changed the optional "colorbarmodel" parameter to an
           optional GETMODEL parameter. 26 June 97. DWF.
       Fixed bug in the way the color palette was assigned. 13 Aug 97. DWF.
       Added missing container object to self structure. 13 Aug 97. DWF.
       Removed image model, which was a workaround for
           broken 5.0 objects. 5 Oct 97. DWF
       Fixed cleanup procedure to clean up ALL objects. 12 Feb 98. DWF.
       Changed IDLgrContainer to IDL_Container to fix 5.1 problems. 20 May 98. DWF.
       Modified colorbar to INHERIT an IDLgrModel object. This allows me to
           add the colorbar to other models directly. 20 Sept 98. DWF.
       Added NAME keyword to give the colorbar a name. 20 Sept 98. DWF.
       Changed a reference to _Ref_Extra to _Extra. 27 Sept 98. DWF.

 NAME:
   xcd

 PURPOSE:
   Change current directory via mouse.

   Two lists are displayed side by side.  The one on the left shows
   directories.  Click on a directory to cd there.  The list
   on the right shows files to help you see where you are.
   (The list on the right does not respond to mouse clicks.)
 CATEGORY:
   Utility.
 CALLING SEQUENCE:
   xcd
 INPUTS:
   None.
 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
   None
 OUTPUTS:
   None.
 SIDE EFFECTS:
   Your current directory can be changed.
 RESTRICTIONS:
   Windows & OpenVMS platforms only.  Originally written on Windows95.
   Should work on other Windows platforms, but I (Paul) havn't tried it.

   With a little effort, one probably could port Xcd to other platforms
   (i.e. Unix or Mac).

   Note that drive names (e.g. "a:", "c:", etc.) are hardcoded in
   xcd::init.  Change that line of code to show drive letters
   appropriate for your system.

 PROCEDURE:
   Xcd creates an object that has a reference to a DirListing, and
   widgets for displaying that DirListing.  If the user clicks on a
   sub-directory (or "..\") in the xcd object, or droplist-selects
   a different drive via the xcd object, the xcd object changes
   IDL's current directory to that location, and refreshes with a
   new current-directory DirListing.

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
   Paul C. Sorenson, July 1997. paulcs@netcom.com.
        Written with IDL 5.0.  The object-oriented design of Xcd is
        based in part on an example authored by Mark Rivers.
   Jim Pendleton, July 1997. jimp@rsinc.com
        Modified for compatability with OpenVMS as a basis for
        platform independent code
   Paul C. Sorenson, July 13 1997.  Changes so that DirListing class
        methods do not return pointers to data members.  (Better
        object-oriented design that way.)

 NAME:
       XCOLORS

 PURPOSE:

       The purpose of this routine is to interactively change color tables
       in a manner similar to XLOADCT. No common blocks are used so
       multiple copies of XCOLORS can be on the display at the same
       time (if each has a different TITLE). XCOLORS has the ability
       to notify a widget event handler, an object method, or an IDL
       procedure if and when a new color table has been loaded. The
       event handler, object method, or IDL procedure is then responsibe
       for updating the program's display on 16- or 24-bit display systems.

 CATEGORY:

       Widgets, Object, Command line.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:

       XCOLORS

 INPUTS:

       None.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

       BLOCK: If this keyword is set, the program will try to block the
          IDL command line. Note that this is only possible if no other
          widget program is currently blocking the IDL command line. It
          is much more reliable to make XCOLORS a modal widget (see the MODAL
          keyword), although this can generally only be done when XCOLORS
          is called from another widget program.

       BOTTOM: The lowest color index of the colors to be changed.

       COLORINFO: This output keyword will return either a pointer to
          a color information structure (if the program is called in
          a non-modal fashion) or a color information structure (if the program
          is called in modal or blocking fashion). The color information
          structure is an anonymous structure defined like this:

             struct = { R: BytArr(!D.Table_Size), $ ; The current R color vector.
                        G: BytArr(!D.Table_Size), $ ; The current G color vector.
                        B: BytArr(!D.Table_Size), $ ; The current B color vector.
                        NAME: "", $                 ; The name of the current color table.
                        INDEX: 0 }                  ; The index number of the current color table.

          If a pointer to the structure is obtained, you will be responsible
          for freeing it to prevent memory leakage:

             XColors, ColorInfo=colorInfoPtr
             Print, "Color Table Name: ", (*colorInfoPtr).Name
             Ptr_Free, colorInfoPtr

          Note that that Name field will be "Unknown" and the Index field will
          be -1 until a color table is actually selected by the user. You are
          responsible for checking this value before you use it.

          When called in modal or blocking fashion, you don't have to worry about freeing
          the pointer, since no pointer is involved:

             XColors, /Block, ColorInfo=colorInfoData
             Help, colorInfoData, /Structure
             Print, "Color Table Name: ", colorInfoData.Name

       DATA: This keyword can be set to any valid IDL variable. If
          the variable is defined, the specified object method or notify
          procedure will be passed this variable via a DATA keyword. This
          keyword is defined primarily so that Notify Procedures are compatible
          with the XLOADCT way of passing data. If is not strictly required,
          since the _EXTRA keyword inheritance mechanism will allow passing
          of *any* keyword parameter defined for the object or procedure that is
          to be notified.

       DRAG: Set this keyword if you want colors loaded as you drag
          the sliders. Default is to update colors only when you release
          the sliders.

       _EXTRA: This keyword inheritance mechanism will pick up and
          pass along to any method or procedure to be notified and keywords
          that are defined for that procedure. Note that you should be sure
          that keywords are spelled correctly. Any mis-spelled keyword will
          be ignored.

       FILE: A string variable pointing to a file that holds the
          color tables to load. The normal colors1.tbl file is used by default.

       GROUP_LEADER: The group leader for this program. When the group
          leader is destroyed, this program will be destroyed.

       MODAL: Set this keyword (along with the GROUP_LEADER keyword) to
          make the XCOLORS dialog a modal widget dialog. Note that NO
          other events can occur until the XCOLORS program is destroyed
          when in modal mode.

       NCOLORS: This is the number of colors to load when a color table
          is selected.

       NOTIFYID: A 2-column by n-row array that contains the IDs of widgets
          that should be notified when XCOLORS loads a color table. The first
          column of the array is the widgets that should be notified. The
          second column contains IDs of widgets that are at the top of the
          hierarchy in which the corresponding widgets in the first column
          are located. (The purpose of the top widget IDs is to make it
          possible for the widget in the first column to get the "info"
          structure of the widget program.) An XCOLORS_LOAD event will be
          sent to the widget identified in the first column. The event
          structure is defined like this:

          event = {XCOLORS_LOAD, ID:0L, TOP:0L, HANDLER:0L, $
             R:BytArr(!D.N_COLORS < 256), G:BytArr(!D.N_COLORS < 256), $
             B:BytArr(!D.N_COLORS < 256), INDEX:0, NAME:""}

          The ID field will be filled out with NOTIFYID[0, n] and the TOP
          field will be filled out with NOTIFYID[1, n]. The R, G, and B
          fields will have the current color table vectors, obtained by
          exectuing the command TVLCT, r, g, b, /Get. The INDEX field will
          have the index number of the just-loaded color table. The name
          field will have the name of the currently loaded color table.

          Note that XCOLORS can't initially tell *which* color table is
          loaded, since it just uses whatever colors are available when it
          is called. Thus, it stores a -1 in the INDEX field to indicate
          this "default" value. Programs that rely on the INDEX field of
          the event structure should normally do nothing if the value is
          set to -1. This value is also set to -1 if the user hits the
          CANCEL button. (Note the NAME field will initially be "Unknown").

          Typically the XCOLORS button will be defined like this:

             xcolorsID = Widget_Button(parentID, Value='Load New Color Table...', $
                Event_Pro='Program_Change_Colors_Event')

          The event handler will be written something like this:

       NOTIFYOBJ: A vector of structures (or a single structure), with
          each element of the vector defined as follows:

             struct = {XCOLORS_NOTIFYOBJ, object:Obj_New(), method:''}

          where the Object field is an object reference, and the Method field
          is the name of the object method that should be called when XCOLORS
          loads its color tables.

             ainfo = {XCOLORS_NOTIFYOBJ, a, 'Draw'}
             binfo = {XCOLORS_NOTIFYOBJ, b, 'Display'}
             XColors, NotifyObj=[ainfo, binfo]

          Note that the XColors program must be compiled before these structures
          are used. Alternatively, you can put this program, named
          "xcolors_notifyobj__define.pro" (*three* underscore characters in this
          name!) in your PATH:

             PRO XCOLORS_NOTIFYOBJ__DEFINE
              struct = {XCOLORS_NOTIFYOBJ, OBJECT:Obj_New(), METHOD:''}
             END

          Or, you can simply define this structure as it is shown here in your code.

          "Extra" keywords added to the XCOLORS call are passed along to
          the object method, which makes this an alternative way to get information
          to your methods. If you expect such keywords, your methods should be defined
          with an _Extra keyword.

       NOTIFYPRO: The name of a procedure to notify or call when the color
          tables are loaded. If the DATA keyword is also defined, it will
          be passed to this program via an DATA keyword. But note that *any*
          keyword appropriate for the procedure can be used in the call to
          XCOLORS. For example, here is a procedure that re-displays and image
          in the current graphics window:

             PRO REFRESH_IMAGE, Image=image, _Extra=extra, WID=wid
             IF N_Elements(wid) NE 0 THEN WSet, wid
             TVIMAGE, image, _Extra=extra
             END

          This program can be invoked with this series of commands:

             IDL> Window, /Free
             IDL> TVImage, image, Position=[0.2, 0.2, 0.8, 0.8]
             IDL> XColors, NotifyPro='Refresh_Image', Image=image, WID=!D.Window

          Note that "extra" keywords added to the XCOLORS call are passed along to
          your procedure, which makes this an alternative way to get information
          to your procedure. If you expect such keywords, your procedure should
          be defined with an _Extra keyword as illustrated above.

       TITLE: This is the window title. It is "Load Color Tables" by
          default. The program is registered with the name 'XCOLORS:' plus
          the TITLE string. The "register name" is checked before the widgets
          are defined. If a program with that name has already been registered
          you cannot register another with that name. This means that you can
          have several versions of XCOLORS open simultaneously as long as each
          has a unique title or name. For example, like this:

            IDL> XColors, NColors=100, Bottom=0, Title='First 100 Colors'
            IDL> XColors, NColors=100, Bottom=100, Title='Second 100 Colors'

       XOFFSET: This is the X offset of the program on the display. The
          program will be placed approximately in the middle of the display
          by default.

       YOFFSET: This is the Y offset of the program on the display. The
          program will be placed approximately in the middle of the display
          by default.

 COMMON BLOCKS:

       None.

 SIDE EFFECTS:

       Colors are changed. Events are sent to widgets if the NOTIFYID
       keyword is used. Object methods are called if the NOTIFYOBJ keyword
       is used. This program is a non-blocking widget.

 RESTRICTIONS:

       None.

 EXAMPLE:

       To load a color table into 100 colors, starting at color index
       50 and send an event to the widget identified at info.drawID
       in the widget heirarchy of the top-level base event.top, type:

       XCOLORS, NCOLORS=100, BOTTOM=50, NOTIFYID=[info.drawID, event.top]

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
       Written by:     David Fanning, 15 April 97. Extensive modification
         of an older XCOLORS program with excellent suggestions for
         improvement by Liam Gumley. Now works on 8-bit and 24-bit
         systems. Subroutines renamed to avoid ambiguity. Cancel
         button restores original color table.
       23 April 1997, added color protection for the program. DWF
       24 April 1997, fixed a window initialization bug. DWF
       18 June 1997, fixed a bug with the color protection handler. DWF
       18 June 1997, Turned tracking on for draw widget to fix a bug
         in TLB Tracking Events for WindowsNT machines in IDL 5.0. DWF

         field holds the current color table index number. DWF.
        5 Dec 1998. Modified the way the colorbar image was created. Results in
         greatly improved display for low number of colors. DWF.

          Not supported on Macs. DWF.
        9 Jul 1999. Fixed a couple of bugs I introduced with the 5 May changes. Sigh... DWF.
       13 Jul 1999. Scheesh! That May 5th change was a BAD idea! Fixed more bugs. DWF.
       31 Jul 1999. Substituted !D.Table_Size for !D.N_Colors. DWF.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       XPlot, x, y

 REQUIRED INPUTS:
       x: A vector of input values used as the dependent data.

 OPTIONAL INPUTS
       y: A vector of input values used as the dependent data.
          If both x and y parameters are present, x is the independent data.

 OPTIONAL KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

       COLORPRINT: Set this keyword to obtain printed output in color.
       If not set (the default), printed output is in black and white.

       EXACT: Set this keyword to a one- or two-element array to set exact axis
       scaling for the axes. If Exact is a one-element array, both axes are
       set to the same value. If Exact is a two-element array, the first
       elements sets the X axis property and the second element sets the Y
       axis property. For example, to set the X axis to exact scaling and
       the Y axis to normal scaling, type:

           IDL> x = Findgen(10)
           IDL> XPlot, x, Sin(x), Exact=[1,0], XRange=[0,8.5]

       _EXTRA: This keyword collects otherwise undefined keywords that are
       passed to new Plot command. To some extent these are similar to the
       old IDL Plot command. For example: Linestyle=2, Thick=3,
       XRange=[-100,100], etc.

       GROUP_LEADER: The group leader for this program. When the group leader
       is destroyed, this program will be destroyed.

       LANDSCAPE: Set this keyword if you are printing in landscape mode. The
       default is Portrait mode. The Landscape keyword on the PRINTER object
       is set, but not all printers will honor this keyword setting. If yours
       does not, set Landscape mode in the Printer Setup dialog.

       PSYM: The index of a plotting symbol to use on the plot. Integers 0-7
       are valid values.

       SYMSIZE: Sets the size of the symbols. By default, symbols are sized
       so that they are 0.015 percent of the axis range.

       VECTOR: Set this keyword if you want the printed output to be in
       vector (as opposed to bitmap) form. This is faster, but not as accurate.

       TITLE: A string used as the title of the plot.

       XTITLE: A string used as the X title of the plot.

       YTITLE: A string used as the Y title of the plot.

 COMMON BLOCKS:
       None.

 SIDE EFFECTS:
       None.

 RESTRICTIONS:
       None.

 EXAMPLE:
       To use this program, pass a 1D vector or vectors, like this:

        IDL> XPlot, RandomU(seed, 11) * 9, YRange=[0, 10]

 NAME:
       XSTRETCH

 PURPOSE:

       The purpose of this program is to interactively apply a simple
       linear stretch to an image by moving two lines on a histogram
       plot of the image. The portion of the image data between the
       two lines is stretched over the available colors in the color table.

 CATEGORY:

       Graphics, Widgets

 CALLING SEQUENCE:

       XSTRETCH, image

 INPUT PARAMETERS:

       image:    The image data to be stretched.It must be 2D. (This may now
                 be a pointer to the image data rather than the image itself.)

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

       COLORTABLE: The index of a colortable you would like to load.
                 The current colortable is used if this keyword is undefined.

       _EXTRA:   This keyword collects any keyword appropriate for the
                 Plot command.

       GROUP_LEADER: Keyword to assign a group leader (so this program can be
                 called from within another widget program).

       MAX_VALUE: Keyword to assign a maximun value for the Histogram Plot.
                 Images with lots of pixels of one color (e.g. black) skew
                 the histogram. This helps make a better looking plot.

       NCOLORS:  Keyword to assign the number of colors used to display
                 the image. The default is !D.Table_Size-4.

 OUTPUTS:
       None.

 COMMON BLOCKS:
       None.

 SIDE EFFECTS:
       None.

 DEPENDENCIES:

       The following programs are required from the Coyote Library:

           tvimage.pro
           pswindow.pro
           psconfig.pro
           fsc_inputfield.pro

           fsc_fileselect.pro
           fsc_plotwindow.pro
           fsc_psconfig__define.pro

 EXAMPLE:

       If you have a 2D image in the variable "image", you can run this
       program like this:

       XSTRETCH, image

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:

       Written by: David Fanning, April 1996.
       October, 1996 Fixed a problem with not restoring the color
          table when the program exited. Substituted a call to XCOLORS
          instead of XLOADCT.
       October, 1998. Added NO_BLOCK keyword and modified to work with
          24-bit color devices.
       April, 1999. Made lines thicker. Offered default image. DWF.
       April, 1999. Replaced TV command with TVIMAGE. DWF.
       April, 1999. Made both windows resizeable. DWF.
       April, 2000. Made several modifications to histogram plot and to
          the way colors were handled. Added ability to pass pointer to
          the image as well as image itself. DWF.
       February 2001. Removed GIF file support for IDL 5.4 and fixed
          a problem with cleaning up the pixmap. DWF.

 NAME:
       ZIMAGE

 PURPOSE:

       The purpose of this program is to display an image which
       can be zoomed by drawing a rubberband box on top of it. The
      "zoomed" image appears in its own window.

 CATEGORY:

      Image Processing, Widgets.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:

      ZIMAGE, image

 INPUTS:

      image:     A 2D array of image data.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

       BOTTOM:   The lowest color index of the colors to be used (see
                 NCOLORS). The default is 0.

       COLORINDEX: The color index for the rubberband box. This index will
                 be loaded with a green color. Whatever color is there will
                 be restored when the ZIMAGE program exits. The default is
                 NCOLORS + BOTTOM.

       NCOLORS:  This is the number of colors to use when displaying the
                 image. The default is !D.N_COLORS-2.

       GROUP_LEADER: This keyword is used to assign a group leader to this
                 program. This program will be destroyed when the group
                 leader is destroyed. Use this keyword if you are calling
                 ZIMAGE from another widget program.

       NOINTERPOLATION: Setting this keyword causes nearest neighbor resampling of
                 of the zoomed image instead of the default bilinear interpolation
                 of resampled pixels.


 OUTPUTS:
       None.

 COMMON BLOCKS:
       None.

 SIDE EFFECTS:

       The COLORINDEX color is turned to green while the rubberband box
       is being drawn. The color is restored after the box is drawn.

 RESTRICTIONS:

       Uses XCOLORS from the Coyote Library:
          http://www.dfanning.com/programs/xcolors.pro

 PROCEDURE:

       Clicking the left mouse button allows you to drag a rubberband box
       over the portion of the window you want to zoom into.

       Clicking the right mouse button calls up hidden controls that allow
       you to load different color tables and set the zoom factor.

       The rubberband box is drawn with pixmaps and the "device copy"
       technique.

       This is an excellent example of how you can take advantage of the
       widget program *as* the loop do to something (i.e., draw the box)
       that in a regular IDL program would have to be done in a loop. Motion
       events are only turned on for the draw widget when the box has to be
       drawn.

 EXAMPLE:

        To display an image you can zoom into, type:

        ZIMAGE, image

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:

        Written by: David Fanning, 15 August 96.
        Fixed a !D.N_Colors problem. 17 June 98.
        Made modifications so program works in 24-bit environment. 28 July 98. DWF.
        Fixed a problem with the pop-up controls under certain circumstances.
          13 Oct 98. DWF.
        Added 24-bit color response. 13 Oct 98. DWF.
        Added ability for each window to have its own color changing tool. 9 Oct 99. DWF.
        Small changes, error checking. 24 April 2000. DWF.
        Modified draw widget error handling to be consistent with current programming
         practices. 26 April 2001. DWF.

 NAME:
       ZOOMBOX

 PURPOSE:

       The purpose of this program is to display an image which
       can be zoomed by drawing a rubberband box on top of it. The

 CATEGORY:

      Widgets.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:

      ZPlot, x, y

 OPTIONAL INPUTS:

      x: If only one positional parameter, this is assumed to be the
         dependent data. If there are two positional parameters, this
         is assumed to be the independent data in accordance with the
         PLOT command.

      y: The dependent data, if the X parameter is present.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

       Any valid PLOT keyword can be used with this program. In additon,
       the following keywords are defined specifically.

       GROUP_LEADER: This keyword is used to assign a group leader to this
                 program. This program will be destroyed when the group
                 leader is destroyed. Use this keyword if you are calling
                 ZIMAGE from another widget program.
